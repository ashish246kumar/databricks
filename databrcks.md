What is the difference between distinct() and dropDuplicates() in Spark?

distinct() and dropDuplicates() are used to remove duplicates in Spark, but the main difference is flexibility.
distinct() removes duplicates by comparing all columns — meaning two rows have to be exactly the same to be considered duplicates.
dropDuplicates(), on the other hand, lets us specify which columns to check for duplicates.
so i use dropDuplicates() when I want to remove duplicates based on business keys
For example, if I do df.dropDuplicates(["name", "city"]), it’ll remove rows that have the same name and city, even if other columns differ.

 __________________________________________________________________________________
 Q: What is lazy evaluation in Spark and how does it benefit performance?
 Lazy evaluation means Spark doesn’t execute transformations immediately. Instead, it builds a logical plan of all the transformations.
 Spark only executes the plan when an action is triggered, such as show(), count(), or collect().
 The benefit is that Spark can optimize the execution plan before running it — it can combine operations, rearrange them, or skip unnecessary work
______________________________________________________________________________
SQL Endpoints in Databricks are compute resources specifically designed for running SQL queries.
They are part of Databricks SQL, which is aimed at analysts and BI tools for querying data in the Lakehouse.
Key points:
Optimized for SQL workloads rather than general-purpose processing.
Supports auto-scaling, query caching, and fast performance.
Integrates with BI tools like Power BI and Tableau.
use SQL Endpoints when I want to run pure SQL queries, especially from dashboards or BI tools, rather than using notebooks or job clusters
 ______________________________________________________
 What is the difference between a Databricks job cluster and an interactive cluster?

Job clusters are temporary clusters used for scheduled jobs and shut down automatically after completion
Used for scheduled or automated tasks like ETL pipelines or production jobs.
Interactive clusters stay alive for development and testing, allowing users to run code and see results immediately.
I develop on interactive clusters and deploy production jobs on job clusters.
 ______________________________________________________________________
 What is an managed table in Databricks?
A managed table in Databricks is a table where both the metadata and the actual data are managed by Databricks.
When I create a managed table (using CREATE TABLE or saveAsTable() without specifying a location), Spark automatically stores the data in the default Databricks-managed storage.
Dropping the table deletes everything, which is ideal when you want Databricks to control the data lifecycle.

__________________________________________________________________________________
 What is an unmanaged table in Databricks?
An unmanaged table (also called an external table) is a table where Databricks only manages the metadata, and the actual data lives outside the default Databricks storage — for example, in a mounted ADLS folder or external storage location.
I usually use unmanaged tables when:
Data is shared across multiple platforms.
I want full control over the storage location.
I don’t want to risk losing data by dropping the table
Databricks manages only the metadata. Dropping the table doesn’t delete the data.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How do you configure the number of cores in a worker in Databricks?

In Databricks, we don’t directly set the number of cores per worker.
Instead, each worker node comes from a cloud instance type (like Standard_D4s_v3 or i3.xlarge), which has a fixed number of vCPUs (cores) and memory.
To configure cores per worker, I:
Go to the cluster configuration page.
Select the worker node type.
Pick an instance with the desired number of cores.
For more parallelism, I can either increase the number of worker nodes or choose larger instances with more cores.
Additionally, I can tune Spark settings like spark.default.parallelism or spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to control how Spark uses these cores efficiently.


________________________________________________________
How do you handle bad records in Databricks during ingestion?

bad records — for example, corrupted rows, missing fields, or data type mismatche
Using badRecordsPath:
spark.read.option("badRecordsPath", "/mnt/errorRecords").csv("/mnt/input")

Using the mode option:
PERMISSIVE (default): Keeps good records and puts null for bad ones.
DROPMALFORMED: Drops the corrupt records.
FAILFAST: Stops immediately on the first bad record.
spark.read.option("mode", "DROPMALFORMED").csv("/mnt/input")

Schema validation
I define an explicit schema instead of letting Spark infer it — this helps detect mismatches and ensures consistent data types

Logging and alerting:


____________________________________________________________________
map() → applies a function to each element individually.
it returns a new RDD with transformed values
rdd = sc.parallelize([1, 2, 3])
rdd2 = rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2)
# Output: [2, 4, 6]

mapPartitions() → applies a function to each partition (batch-wise), not element by element.
Used when you want better performance or resource reuse per partition.
def process_partition(iterator):
    return (x * 2 for x in iterator)
rdd2 = rdd.mapPartitions(process_partition)

________________________________________________________________________
63. What is an accumulator in Spark and how is it used? 

An accumulator in Spark is a variable used to collect information like counts or sums across tasks
It’s mainly used for monitoring or debugging, like counting how many records meet a condition or how many errors occurred —
A key point to remember is that accumulators aren’t reliable for logic, because Spark may re-run tasks if there’s a failure or retry — which can cause the count to increase multiple times.
______________________________________________________________________________
broadcast variable

A broadcast variable in Spark is a read-only shared variable that’s sent to all executors only once, instead of sending a copy with every task.
It’s mainly used when we have a small lookup table or reference data that needs to be used across multiple tasks.

broadcastVar = sc.broadcast({"CA": "California", "NY": "New York"})
def map_state(abbr):
    return broadcastVar.value.get(abbr, "Unknown")
rdd.map(map_state)

___________________________________________________________________________
What is the default number of shuffle partitions in Spark?

The default number of shuffle partitions in Spark is 200.
This means whenever a wide transformation occurs — like groupBy, join, or reduceByKey — Spark divides the shuffled data into 200 partitions by default.
This default value works fine for small to medium datasets, but for large datasets, I usually increase it to improve parallelism.
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.shuffle.partitions", 100)
So, tuning this value is an important part of Spark performance optimization, especially for shuffle-heavy operations.
___________________________________________________________________________
What is the default partition size in Spark, and how is it calculated? 

Spark targets around 128 MB per partition when reading data — this comes from the Hadoop block size

So, if I have a 1 GB file, Spark will create roughly 8 partitions (1 GB ÷ 128 MB).
This helps distribute the data evenly across executors for parallel processing.
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes", 134217728)  # 128 MB

The actual number of partitions also depends on factors like:
Number of available cores
File format and block size
Manual repartitioning using .repartition() or .coalesce()

______________________________________________________________________________________
How are zip files distributed across nodes in Spark? 


Spark can’t split most compressed files like ZIP or GZIP across multiple nodes because these formats are not splittable.
So, if I have one large ZIP file, it will be processed by a single executor instead of being distributed.
This reduces performance since Spark can’t parallelize the reading.
Or, if compression is needed, I use splittable formats like bzip2 or, better yet, use Parquet, which is optimized for parallel reads.

______________________________________________________________________________________________
Databricks widgets make notebooks interactive.
They let us pass inputs like dates or file paths using text boxes or dropdowns instead of hardcoding values.
For example, we can create a text widget and fetch its value using dbutils.widgets.get().
They’re very useful for parameterizing notebooks when running in different environments or through Databricks Jobs.

dbutils.widgets.text("input_date", "2024-01-01", "Date")
date_value = dbutils.widgets.get("input_date")

______________________________________________________________________________
Q How can you combine data into a single output file in Databricks?
By default, Spark. writes multiple files — one for each partition.
If I want a single output file, I use coalesce(1) before writing.
df.coalesce(1).write.mode("overwrite").csv("/mnt/output")
This merges all partitions into one and creates a single file.
But I use it only for small or medium datasets — for large data, it’s better to keep multiple files and combine them later using tools like Azure Data Factory or a script.


_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Delta Live Tables (DLT) in Databricks lets you build automated, reliable ETL pipelines using simple declarative code. It manages table dependencies, incremental processing, data quality checks, and logging, producing production-ready Delta tables that are easier to monitor and maintain

It simplifies ETL by managing table dependencies, orchestration, incremental processing, and data quality checks

Declarative pipeline definition: Use SQL or Python with decorators like @dlt.table to define transformations.

Automatic orchestration: DLT detects dependencies between tables and runs them in the correct order.

Incremental processing & reliability: Handles retries, logging, and incremental data automatically.

Data quality checks: Define expectations to validate data as it flows through the pipeline.

Managed Delta tables & lineage: Automatically creates tables, tracks metadata, and logs lineage for easier monitoring and debugging

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Autoloader

Auto Loader is a Databricks feature that simplifies incremental, scalable, and schema-aware ingestion of new data files from cloud storage like ADLS or S3. It supports both streaming and batch workloads
File detection: Automatically monitors a cloud directory for new files.
Schema inference & evolution: Detects the structure of incoming data and adapts to changes.
Streaming support: Works with Spark Structured Streaming to process files in real-time as they arrive.
Checkpointing: Tracks processed files so data isn’t ingested twice.

File detection: Automatically monitors a cloud directory for new files.
Schema inference & evolution: Detects the structure of incoming data and adapts to changes.
Streaming support: Works with Spark Structured Streaming to process files in real-time as they arrive.
Batch-like behavior: Can run in trigger once mode to process all available data and then stop.
Checkpointing: Tracks processed files so data isn’t ingested twice

__________________________________________________________________________________________________

coalesce() reduces partitions without shuffle, making it fast and efficient for writing data. repartition() can increase or decrease partitions, but triggers a full shuffle to evenly distribute data. The drawback of coalesce() is that it can create uneven partitions, cause skew, or underutilize cluster resources if used excessively

coalesce() — Merging Buckets Without Moving Water Too Much
You want fewer buckets (e.g., 4 buckets instead of 10).
You merge adjacent buckets: pour some water from one bucket into a nearby bucket.
No shaking or redistributing water across all buckets.
✅ Fast and efficient
⚠ But some buckets may end up bigger than others → uneven workload


repartition() — Shuffling Water Across All Buckets
You want evenly distributed buckets (e.g., 4 buckets from 10).
You shake and redistribute water so each bucket has roughly the same amount.
✅ Balanced workload
⚠ Slower because all the water (data) moves across buckets

Drawbacks of coalesce():
Uneven partition sizes — can cause skew and slower tasks.
Can only reduce partitions — cannot increase partitions reliably.
Small file problem — too few or too many partitions can affect storage efficiency.
Potential bottleneck — reducing to very few partitions may hurt parallelism.
Usage tip:
“I use coalesce() when I want to shrink partitions quickly and efficiently, like before writing output, and repartition() when I need to balance data across partitions, such as before joins or groupBy operations


___________________________________________________________________________
Out-of-memory (OOM) issues in Spark occur when an executor or driver runs out of available memory, causing tasks to fail or even the application to crash

Too much data in one partition — a single executor tries to process a very large partition.
Improper caching — caching unnecessary data or forgetting to unpersist.
Large shuffles — operations like joins, groupBy, or aggregations that move lots of data across nodes.

Resolutions:
Repartition/coalesce to balance partitions.
Increase executor or driver memory via spark.executor.memory and spark.driver.memory.
Use efficient file formats like Parquet or Delta, with column pruning and early filters.
Avoid .collect() on large datasets; use .show() or .limit() instead.
Broadcast only small datasets in joins
________________________________________________________________________

41. What is data skewness and how does it impact Spark performance?


Data skewness occurs when data is unevenly distributed across partitions in Spark — for example, during a join or groupBy when certain keys have much more data than others.
Impact on performance:
Some tasks process large partitions and take much longer, while others finish quickly.
This causes job delays, idle executors, and sometimes out-of-memory errors.
As a result, Spark loses parallelism and the overall performance drops.

Salting: Add a random suffix to skewed keys to spread them across more partitions.
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, concat, lit, rand
df = df.withColumn("salted_key", concat(col("key"), lit("_"), (rand() * 10).cast

Enable Skew Join Optimization:
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled", "true")

Repartition: Repartition on key columns to rebalance data.
df = df.repartition(10, "key")


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
What is the name of the platform that enables the execution of Databricks applications

The platform that actually executes Databricks applications is Apache Spark.
Azure Databricks is built on top of Spark, which is a powerful open-source distributed computing engine. 
Spark processes large amounts of data in parallel across a cluster of machines, which makes it very fast and scalable
Databricks enhances Spark by adding features like Delta Lake integration, and easy connectivity with Azure services. But underneath all that, Spark is the core engine that executes all the code
_____________________________________________________________________________
43. How do you mount Azure Data Lake Storage to Databricks?
    To connect Azure Data Lake to Databricks, I mount the storage using the dbutils.fs.mount() command. This links ADLS to the Databricks File System (DBFS), making the data available like a local directory

Here's how I usually do it: 
Get the storage credentials — this includes the storage account name, container name, and authentication details (like service principal credentials or managed identity).
Use the dbutils.fs.mount() command to mount ADLS to a mount point in DBFS. For example:
configs = {
  "fs.azure.account.auth.type": "OAuth",
  "fs.azure.account.oauth.provider.type": "org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.oauth2.ClientCredsTokenProvider",
  "fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id": "<application-id>",
  "fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret": "<application-secret>",
  "fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/oauth2/token"
}

dbutils.fs.mount(
  source = "abfss://<container-name>@<storage-account-name>.dfs.core.windows.net/",
  mount_point = "/mnt/<mount-name>",
  extra_configs = configs)

Access the files just like local files, for example:
spark.read.csv("/mnt/<mount-name>/data.csv")

______________________________________________________

4. What are the various optimization techniques in Spark?

Partitioning Optimization:
 There are several techniques I use to optimize Spark jobs for better performance and lower resource usage
   Use repartition() or coalesce() to control the number of partitions, and partition data by key columns to reduce shuffling

Caching and Persistence:
Cache intermediate DataFrames that are reused and unpersist() them when no longer needed   
Broadcast Joins:
Broadcast smaller DataFrames to avoid large shuffles in joins.
Adaptive Query Execution (AQE):
Enable AQE (spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true) so Spark can optimize execution plans at runtime

Filter and select only the required data early on. File formats like Parquet and Delta support this efficiently

Delta Lake Optimization:
Delta format improves performance through indexing, caching, and ACID capabilities.

Use Efficient File Formats:
Prefer Parquet or Delta over CSV/JSON for better compression and faster read/write.
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
df_joined = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "customer_id")
_______________________________________
The dataset had too many small partitions, so I optimized it:
large_df = large_df.repartition(8, "customer_region")
______________________________________________________
df_joined.cache()


_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
When referring to Azure Databricks, what exactly does it mean to "auto-scale" a cluster

Auto-scaling in Azure Databricks means that the cluster can automatically increase or decrease the number of worker nodes based on the workload. For example, if I run a heavy job that needs more processing power, Databricks will automatically add more nodes. When the workload reduces, it will remove the extra nodes to save cost.

So basically, I don’t have to manually adjust the cluster size — Databricks takes care of it for me. This helps improve performance when needed and also keeps costs under control. For instance, if my cluster is set to auto-scale between 2 and 8 workers, it might start with 2, scale up to 8 during peak load, and then go back down to 2 when the job finishes


______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Why is it necessary for us to use the DBU Framework? D

DBU stands for Databricks Unit. It’s basically a unit that measures the processing power used per hour in Azure Databricks.
Using the DBU framework is important because it helps track and control the cost of running workloads. 
Different workloads and cluster types consume different amounts of DBUs, so it gives a clear idea of how much a job will cost before running it.
It also separates the Databricks cost from the underlying VM cost, which makes budgeting and cost management much easier and more transparent


_______________________________________________________________________________________________________
What is the function of the Databricks filesystem? 

The Databricks File System, or DBFS, is a distributed file system built on top of cloud storage.
It acts like a bridge between Databricks and the underlying cloud storage, such as Azure Blob Storage.
For example, I can upload a CSV file to DBFS and read it using a path like /dbfs/FileStore/mydata.csv.
The main functions of DBFS are:
Storing input and output data used in Spark jobs or ML models.
Serving as a temporary workspace for intermediate files.
____________________________________________________________________
 What is a delta table in Databricks? 
 
A Delta table is a Databricks table built on Delta Lake. 
It adds features like ACID transactions, version control, and schema enforcement to data lakes — so I can manage big data with the reliability of a traditional database
think of it as a smart version of a data lake table that supports both batch and streaming data efficiently.

ACID Transactions: Ensures data consistency even with concurrent reads and writes.
Schema Evolution: Allows adding or modifying columns easily.
Efficient Updates & Deletes: Supports SQL operations like UPDATE, DELETE, and MERGE.
High Performance: Uses indexing and caching for faster queries.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. What is Azure Databricks and advantages

Azure Databricks is a cloud-based big data and machine learning platform built on Apache Spark and integrated with Microsoft Azure.
It provides an interactive and collaborative environment where I can use Python, SQL, or Scala to process large datasets efficiently.
What I like most is that it handles cluster setup and scaling automatically, integrates well with services like Azure Data Lake, Synapse, and Power BI, 
and provides strong security using Azure’s RBAC.
For example, I can read raw customer data from Azure Data Lake, clean and transform it in Databricks, train a machine learning model, and then visualize 
the results in Power BI — all within one environment.

4. Built-in Security and Integration
  You can connect Databricks securely to:
Azure Data Lake (for raw data)
Azure Key Vault (for secrets)

Azure Synapse (for analytics)
without exposing passwords or tokens.

5. Supports Multiple Languages
6. Job Orchestration
Why: You can schedule, monitor, and automate data workflows directly in Databricks

Security Risks: Sensitive data leak ho sakta hai agar access control aur encryption strong nahi hai.
Poor Data Quality: Raw data mein errors, missing values, ya inconsistent formats se analytics galat hota hai.
Slow Performance: Bade data volumes aur small files se queries slow ho jati hain, real-time insights nahi milte.
Business Misalignment: Business goals ke saath align nahi hota, toh data lake sirf storage ban jata hai.
Complexity in Data Processing
Problem: Data lake mein raw data process karna complex hota hai, especially streaming data aur batch data ko combine karna

DBSQL ke “Query History” section mein har query ka record hota hai – execution time, status (success/failed), aur resource usage

*******
In Apache Spark, yeh cluster has one boss called "master" and kai saare workers called "nodes" that do kaam together
********
 Spark ka Core Architecture
Spark ka architecture Master-Slave model pe based hota hai. Matlab ek Driver Program hota hai jo Executors ko kaam assign karta hai.

🖥 Driver Program:

Ye main process hota hai jo job ko initiate karta hai.
Iske andar ek SparkContext hota hai jo pura execution manage karta hai.
⚡ Cluster Manager:

Ye resources allocate karta hai.
Spark ke cluster manager YARN, Mesos ya Standalone mode me ho sakte hain.
🖥 Executors:

Ye worker nodes hote hain jo actual computation karte hain.
Driver inko kaam assign karta hai aur ye tasks execute karte hain.


Spark ke Major Components
🚀 Spark Core:

Isme RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) hote hain jo distributed processing ka main part hain.
Task scheduling, Memory Management, Fault tolerance yahi handle karta hai.
📊 Spark SQL:

Ye structured data ke liye hota hai.
Isme DataFrames and Datasets hote hain jo SQL queries ko optimize karte hain.
🔥 Spark Streaming:

Ye real-time data processing ke liye hota hai.
Kafka, Flume, socket streams se data le sakta hai.


Apache Spark Workflow
1️⃣ Data Load: Data kisi bhi source se aa sakta hai (HDFS, S3, DB).
2️⃣ RDD Creation: Spark Core RDDs create karta hai.
3️⃣ Transformations: Operations perform hote hain jaise map(), filter(), reduce().
4️⃣ Actions: Jab hum result chahiye toh actions like collect(), count() use hote hain.
5️⃣ Execution & Optimization: Spark DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) banata hai jo efficient execution karta hai.
6️⃣ Results: Data ko visualize kar sakte hain ya kisi DB me store kar sakte hain.


Spark Execution Model
Transformations → Lazy execution hoti hai, jab tak action call na ho.
Actions → Actual computation hoti hai.
DAG Scheduler → Task ko optimize karta hai.
Task Execution → Executors tasks execute karte hain aur results bhejte hain.

Delta Table Merge Kya Hai?
Merge is like ek smart operation jo Delta Table mein data ko update, insert, ya delete karne ka kaam ek saath karta hai. Matlab, agar tumhare paas ek purani Delta Table hai aur ek nayi data ka source hai (jaise koi file ya table), toh tum dono ko "merge" kar sakte ho – jahan chahiye wahan update karo, jahan naya data hai wahan add karo, aur jahan remove karna hai wahan delete karo

MERGE INTO students AS purani_table
USING nayi_data AS nayi_table
ON purani_table.id = nayi_table.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN 
  UPDATE SET purani_table.marks = nayi_table.marks
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN 
  INSERT (id, marks) VALUES (nayi_table.id, nayi_table.marks);
*******
How to do soft delete of Incremental data using Merge Statement?

MERGE INTO target_table AS tgt
USING staging_table AS src
ON tgt.id = src.id  -- Matching condition based on primary key
WHEN MATCHED AND src.id IS NOT NULL THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        tgt.name = src.name,
        tgt.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
        tgt.is_deleted = 0  -- Reactivate if it was marked deleted
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (id, name, created_at, is_deleted)
    VALUES (src.id, src.name, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, 0)
WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        tgt.is_deleted = 1,  -- Soft delete records not in incremental data
        tgt.updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;


If the record is in target_table but not in staging_table (NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE case):
Mark is_deleted = 1 (Soft delete).

Slowly Changing Dimension Type 1 (SCD1) using MERGE in Delta Tables

SCD Type 1 (SCD1) overwrites existing records with new data, without maintaining historical records. Delta Tables in Databricks or Apache Spark support MERGE operations efficiently.
