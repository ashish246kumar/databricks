Data Warehouse (DW) — ek central storage hota hai jahan company ka saara data ek jagah rakha jata hai, taaki usko analyze karke better business decisions liye ja sake.

Main points yaad rakhne ke liye (Inmon’s rules):

🧩 Integrated – Different sources ka data ek saath.

📚 Subject-oriented – Topic-wise data (like Sales, Customer).

⏳ Time-variant – Old + New data dono (for trend analysis).

🧱 Non-volatile – Data stable hota hai; change nahi hota analysis ke time.

Use: Fast reporting, analysis, aur decision-making ke liye.
Data: Copy hota hai (move nahi hota) from source systems

  Data Warehouse vs Data Lake – Quick Study Notes
🏢 Data Warehouse
Built on relational databases (like SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2).
Stores structured data in a fixed schema (schema-on-write).
Used mainly for Business Intelligence (BI), reporting, and analytics.
Data is cleaned and processed before storage.
Used by business analysts and executives.
High performance for SQL queries.
High data quality (validated and consistent).
Higher storage cost because data is processed and structured.
Example tools: 🧰 Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery.

🌊 Data Lake
Built on big data platforms (not traditional RDBMS).
Handles raw data — structured, semi-structured, and unstructured.
Used for Big Data, Machine Learning (ML), and advanced analytics.
Data is stored as-is (processed later when needed) → schema-on-read.
Used by data scientists and engineers.
Optimized for large-scale data processing (not just SQL).
Data quality varies (may include raw or dirty data).
Lower storage cost (raw format, no preprocessing).
Example tools: ⚙️ Hadoop, Spark, Azure Data Lake.

4. Simple End-to-End Data Warehouse Environment 

  A Data Warehouse Environment mainly includes:
Data Sources
ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)
Data Warehouse
Data Marts
End Users / BI Tools
Process Flow:

1. Data Sources (Suppliers):
– Data comes from different systems (CRM, ERP, flat files, APIs, etc.).
– These act like suppliers providing raw data.

2. ETL Process (Middleman):
– E (Extract): Get data from multiple sources.
– T (Transform): Clean, filter, and convert into a standard format.
– L (Load): Store the processed data into the data warehouse.
🧠 ETL = Bridge between data sources and data warehouse.

3. Data Warehouse (Wholesaler):
– Central storage that collects all the transformed data.
– Provides a single, organized, historical view of company data.

4. Data Marts (Retailers):
– Smaller sections of the data warehouse, focused on specific business domains (like Sales, HR, Finance).
– Users access these data marts for analysis and reporting.

  Types of Data Marts:

Dependent Data Mart:
– Gets data from the central data warehouse (already processed).

Independent Data Mart:
– Gets data directly from external sources (without depending on a warehouse).

Hybrid Data Mart:
– Uses data from both warehouse and external sources

13. What are the characteristics of a data warehouse?

Subject-Oriented
A data warehouse is built around key business subjects like sales, customers, or marketing — not day-to-day operations.
A data warehouse is subject-oriented because it organizes data around major business areas like sales or finance,
making it easier to analyze and make strategic decisions.

Integrated
Data comes from multiple sources — like databases, files, mainframes — and is converted into a consistent format.
Integration ensures uniform naming conventions, data types, and coding standards.

Time-Variant
A data warehouse is time-variant because it keeps historical
Once data is stored, it’s not updated or overwritten, so you can track past trends.

Non-Volatile
Once data enters the warehouse, it’s stable and not changed (no updates or deletes).
Data is read-only and refreshed periodically
____________________________________________________________________________________
difference between Data Warehouse and Database
Purpose
Data Warehouse: Used for analysis and reporting — helps understand trends, patterns, and make business decisions (OLAP).
Database: Used for daily operations like insert, update, delete — helps run applications smoothly (OLTP).
2️⃣ Data Type
Data Warehouse: Stores historical and summarized data — e.g., last 5 years’ sales data.
Database: Stores current and live data — e.g., today’s transactions.
3️⃣ Data Structure
Data Warehouse: Designed for complex queries and analysis, not frequent updates.
Database: Designed for fast read/write operations — quick transactions.
4️⃣ Schema Design
Data Warehouse: Usually denormalized (like Star or Snowflake Schema) to make queries faster.
Database: Normalized (3NF or more) to avoid data redundancy and maintain consistency.
5️⃣ Data Volume
Data Warehouse: Holds large volumes of data (terabytes or petabytes).
Database: Handles smaller data volumes (GBs or TBs).
6️⃣ Write Operations
Data Warehouse: Data is loaded in batches using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load).
Database: Data is continuously updated in real time by users or applications

19. Data Warehousing Storage Layouts: Row vs. Column vs. Hybrid Stores 
(example see from notes)


| **Feature**              | **Row-Store (Row-Oriented)**                                                  | **Column-Store (Column-Oriented)**                                                    | **Hybrid Store (Row + Column)**                                    |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **How It Works**         | Stores data **row by row** — all columns of a record are stored together.     | Stores data **column by column** — all values of a single column are stored together. | Combines **row and column storage** in a single system.            |
| **Optimized For**        | **OLTP (Transactional systems)**                                              | **OLAP (Analytical systems)**                                                         | **Mixed workloads** (both OLTP + OLAP).                            |
| **Performance Strength** | Fast for **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** and retrieving full rows.                 | Fast for **aggregations and analytical queries** on few columns.                      | Balances both **transaction and analytics** performance.           |
| **Weakness**             | Slow for analytical queries (scans full rows even if few columns are needed). | Slow for transactional updates (updating one record rewrites multiple columns).       | More **complex** and **higher storage overhead**.                  |
| **Compression**          | Poor compression (redundant column data).                                     | Excellent compression (similar column data compresses well).                          | Moderate — depends on system implementation.                       |
| **When to Use**          | Transaction-heavy systems (e.g., banking, e-commerce).                        | Data warehousing, reporting, analytics.                                               | Systems needing **real-time analytics** on transactional data.     |
| **Example Systems**      | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle (row format).                                       | Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery.                                          | SQL Server (with Columnstore Indexes), Oracle In-Memory, SAP HANA. |
| **Example Query Type**   | `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id=100;`                                       | `SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales;`                                                     | Both transactional + analytical queries together.                  |

| **Flexibility**             | Follows **schema-on-write** (structure fixed before loading)  | Follows **schema-on-read** (structure applied when querying)        |
| **Implementation**          | Requires a **staging area** for transformations               | **No staging area** needed                                          |
| **Latency**                 | **Higher latency**, as data is processed before loading       | **Lower latency**, as raw data loads quickly                        |
| **Cost**                    | **Higher**, needs separate ETL infrastructure                 | **Lower**, uses target system’s compute power                       |

| **Single-Tier Architecture** | Aims to minimize data storage by eliminating redundant data. Combines all components (data source, storage, and presentation) into a single layer. Rarely used in practice. | Single hardware and software layer                                                                                                                                                            | • Simplifies system design <br> • Reduces data redundancy                                              | • Poor performance <br> • Not scalable <br> • Difficult for analytics                 | Mostly theoretical — not used in real-world systems       |
| **Two-Tier Architecture**    | Separates data warehouse (server) and client (presentation) layers. Client directly interacts with the data warehouse for analysis and reporting.                           | 1️⃣ Data Warehouse (Database Server) <br> 2️⃣ Client Layer (OLAP / Reporting Tools)                                                                                                           | • Faster data access <br> • Simple architecture <br> • Easy to implement                               | • Limited scalability <br> • High network load <br> • Poor performance for many users | Small or medium organizations with moderate data          |
| **Three-Tier Architecture**  | Most common and modern architecture. Adds a middle **OLAP / Application Layer** between client and database for efficient processing.                                       | 1️⃣ **Bottom Tier** – Data Warehouse Database (ETL + Storage) <br> 2️⃣ **Middle Tier** – OLAP Server (ROLAP / MOLAP) <br> 3️⃣ **Top Tier** – Front-End Tools (Reports, Dashboards, Analytics) | • Highly scalable <br> • Better performance <br> • Supports large data volumes <br> • Easy maintenance | • Slightly complex to design <br> • Higher setup cost                                 | Large enterprises and modern cloud data warehouse systems |

🧠 How to Explain in an Interview

“In a Single-tier architecture, everything happens in one layer — simple but not scalable.
In a Two-tier architecture, the client directly queries the warehouse, which is faster but not efficient for many users.
The Three-tier architecture, which is most common, separates data storage, processing, and presentation — improving scalability, performance, and manageability.
For example, in a banking data warehouse, ETL tools load data into a relational warehouse (bottom tier), OLAP servers process it (middle tier), and dashboards like Power BI show insights (top tier).”

single tier
Example: A small startup using a single Excel file or a standalone SQL database to analyze monthly sales data.

retail tier
Example: A retail company using SQL Server as data warehouse and Power BI or Excel directly connecting to it for dashboards.
