What is data modeling, and why is it important?

Answer: Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of the data structure and relationships within a database. It is important because it helps in understanding the data requirements, designing efficient databases, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating communication between stakeholders.

What are the different types of data models?

Answer: There are three main types of data models:
Conceptual data model: Represents high-level entities and relationships without considering implementation details.

Logical data model: Defines the structure of the data without considering how it will be physically implemented.

Physical data model: Specifies the physical implementation of the database, including tables, columns, indexes, etc.

What is normalization and denormalization?

Answer: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them. 

Denormalization, on the other hand, involves adding redundant data to improve query performance by reducing the need for joins.


What are surrogate keys and natural keys?

Answer: Surrogate keys are artificial keys generated solely for identifying records in a table, while natural keys are attributes that already exist in the real world and can uniquely identify records.

Explain the differences between OLTP and OLAP.
Answer: OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) is designed for transaction-oriented applications that involve frequent, short transactions, while OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is optimized for complex queries and analysis of large volumes of data.

What is a star schema and snowflake schema?

Answer: A star schema is a data warehouse schema that consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimension tables. In a snowflake schema, dimension tables are normalized into multiple related tables, resulting in a more normalized structure.

How do you handle slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) in data modeling?

Answer: Slowly changing dimensions are dimensions that change over time. They can be handled using various techniques such as Type 1 (overwrite), Type 2 (add new row), and Type 3 (add new column). The choice depends on the specific requirements of the business.

What is cardinality in data modeling?

Answer: Cardinality refers to the relationship between rows of two tables. It describes the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with a single instance of another entity.

How would you process a large CSV file in chunks, filter only the required rows, and write the filtered data into a new file using Python?

# Step 1: Read CSV in chunks (distributed automatically by Spark)
df = spark.read.csv("s3://bucket-name/large_file.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

# Step 2: Filter only required rows (example condition)
# Example: select rows where 'country' is 'India' and 'sales' > 1000
filtered_df = df.filter((col("country") == "India") & (col("sales") > 1000))

# Step 3: Write filtered data into new CSV (or parquet) file
filtered_df.write.mode("overwrite").csv("s3://bucket-name/filtered_output/")

✅ If You Want Manual Chunk Processing (Less Common in Spark)
If your CSV is extremely large and you want to control chunking manually:
df = spark.read.option("maxRecordsPerFile", 1000000).csv("path/to/large.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)

A table has start_date and end_date columns — how would you calculate the total number of overlapping days across all rows?


SELECT 
    SUM(
        DATEDIFF(
            LEAST(a.end_date, b.end_date),
            GREATEST(a.start_date, b.start_date)
        ) + 1
    ) AS total_overlap_days
FROM events a
JOIN events b 
  ON a.id < b.id  -- avoid self-join duplicates
 AND a.start_date <= b.end_date
 AND b.start_date <= a.end_date;

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How would you identify duplicate records in a table and delete only the duplicates while retaining one original record?

You can use ROW_NUMBER() to assign a unique rank to each duplicate group.
____________________________________________________________________________________
How do you remove duplicates and handle nulls in PySpark?

clean_df = df.dropDuplicates(['emp_id']).na.fill({'age': 0, 'city': 'Unknown'})
________________________________________________
How do you handle Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2)?

Compare source and target using business keys.
Update old record's end_date and is_active=false.
Insert new record with start_date=current_date().
Example (Delta Merge):
MERGE INTO dim customer t
USING updates s
ON t.cust id = s.cust_id
WHEN MATCHED AND t.email <> s.email THEN
UPDATE SET t.is_active=false, t.end_date=current_date()

Design a simple data pipeline on AWS for daily data ingestion.

Ingest: S3 (landing zone) + EventBridge trigger
Process: AWS Glue job (PySpark ETL)
Store: S3 curated → Redshift
Orchestrate: Step Functions / Lambda
Secure: IAM roles + KMS encryption
___________________________________________________________
Tell me about a time your pipeline failed in production.
What I said:
"Our ADF job failed due to missing files. I added file existence checks + retry logic → reduced daily failures by 95%."
___________________________________________
How do you measure data pipeline performance? .

We measure data pipeline performance using key metrics like throughput, latency, and resource utilization.
Track throughput (rows/sec). 
Monitor failure rates via CloudWatch/ADF logs. 
We set up Grafana dashboards and alerts to visualize performance trends and detect anomalies early.

__________________________________________________________________

How do you ensure data accuracy and quality in ETL pipelines?

Perform schema validation before processing (column count, data types).
Apply data profiling and threshold checks (null%, duplicates).
Store invalid data separately in an error zone for audit.
Log validation results in a control table.
Automate alerts for any deviation beyond tolerance.

How do you optimize Delta Lake tables for performance and cost?

We optimize Delta tables using Z-Ordering, OPTIMIZE for file compaction, and VACUUM for cleanup.
With a good partitioning strategy and Parquet-based compression, we improved query performance by 65% while reducing storage cost

We optimize Delta Lake tables by using multiple techniques to improve performance and reduce cost.
We use Z-Ordering on high-selectivity columns like region and sale_date to improve query performance by clustering related data together.
We periodically run OPTIMIZE to compact small files into larger ones, reducing file overhead and improving read efficiency.
We also schedule VACUUM to remove old or unused files and free up storage space.
Data is stored in Parquet with Delta format, ensuring efficient compression and faster access.
We design proper partitioning strategies to balance between parallelism and metadata overhead.

What's the difference between Azure Synapse and Databricks when would you use each?

Databricks: Best for ETL, big data, and transformation using PySpark.
Synapse: Best for serving analytical queries to BI tools (e.g., Power BI).
In our project → Databricks handled transformation, Synapse served reporting data.

How do you reduce data storage and compute costs in Azure ?

For storage, we use lifecycle management policies to move old or infrequently used data to cool or archive tiers in Azure Data Lake or Blob Storage.
We compress data and store it in efficient formats like Parquet or Delta, which reduce both size and read costs.
For compute, we use auto-scaling and job clusters in Databricks so clusters run only when needed.

Use Delta Lake for storage efficiency and caching for faster reads.
Schedule jobs during off-peak hours to use lower-cost compute.
Consolidate small files (“small file problem”) in ADLS to reduce metadata overhead.

Delta Lake improves storage efficiency by storing data in the Parquet format, which is a highly compressed and columnar storage type.
It supports data versioning (time travel) using transaction logs instead of keeping multiple file copies, saving storage space
Features like data skipping and Z-ordering make queries faster by reading only the necessary data blocks.
It supports schema evolution without needing to reload data, which saves both time and resources.

File format: Delta Lake builds on top of Parquet → efficient compression (Snappy, Gzip).
Transaction log (_delta_log): Stores metadata instead of duplicating data → minimal overhead


______________________________________________________________________________


How do you process streaming data in Databricks or AWS?

In our project, we process streaming data in Databricks using Spark Structured Streaming.
The data is consumed from Kafka topics in real time using the Databricks readStream API.
We define a streaming DataFrame to process incoming data — applying transformations, filters, and aggregations.
The processed data is then written to different sinks like Delta tables, Azure Data Lake, or another Kafka topic using writeStream.
We use checkpointing and watermarking to handle fault tolerance and late-arriving data.
The jobs are scheduled and monitored in Databricks workflows, ensuring reliable and continuous data processing.
This setup allows us to build real-time pipelines for analytics and dashboarding.

stream df.writeStream.format("delta")
.option("checkpoint Location", "/mnt/chkpt/")
.start("/mnt/output/")
___________________________________________________________
How do you implement data governance and lineage in Azure?

Use Azure Purview for data discovery, cataloging, and lineage tracking.
Store metadata centrally in Data Catalog (Glue Catalog in AWS).
Assign access via RBAC and Purview roles.

Tool for Governance: Azure Purview (now part of Microsoft Fabric governance).
For Data Lineage: Purview integrates with Data Factory and Databricks pipelines to trace the complete data flow.
For Access Control: Azure AD roles + managed identities.
For Data Security: Sensitivity labels, encryption, and Key Vault

Purview helps us discover, classify, and catalog data across Azure services like Data Lake, SQL, and Databricks.
It automatically captures data lineage, showing how data moves from source to transformation to reports.
We define data policies, access control, and sensitivity labels in Purview to ensure data security and compliance.
We also use Azure AD for role-based access and integrate with Key Vault for managing secrets.

how do you handle ci/cd for databricks

In our project, we set up CI/CD for Databricks using Azure DevOps pipelines to move code across different environments like Dev, QA, and Prod.
We use ARM templates to automatically create and configure Databricks workspaces for each environment.
Our YAML pipeline builds the code and creates a .bundle file that contains notebooks, jobs, and all needed files.
This bundle is then deployed to the target environment using an automated release pipeline.
We manage environment-specific details like URLs and secrets using pipeline variables.
This setup helps us deploy faster, avoid manual errors, and keep all environments consistent.


_______________________________________________________________
Batch processing deals with large data sets in bulk — it’s great for analytics and reporting where latency isn’t critical. Real-time processing, 
on the other hand, processes data continuously as it arrives — useful when immediate insights or actions are required.
For example, a bank might use real-time processing to detect fraudulent transactions instantly, but use batch processing to generate end-of-day reports.
The trade-off is between latency and complexity — batch is simpler and cheaper, while real-time gives instant insights but requires more complex infrastructure.

__________________________________________________________________________
How do you ensure the scalability of a data pipeline handling rapidly growing data volumes.

To ensure scalability of a data pipeline handling rapidly growing data volumes, 
I focus on building a distributed, decoupled, and elastic architecture — one that can scale horizontally, process data in parallel, and handle spikes efficiently

(a) Use Distributed Processing Frameworks
I’d use distributed systems like Apache Spark.that can process large datasets in parallel across multiple nodes instead of relying on a single machine.
🔹 Example: Spark can automatically distribute the workload and scale horizontally when more data or nodes are added.

(b) Decouple Components
I ensure the pipeline components (ingestion, processing, storage, and serving) are loosely coupled using message queues or streaming systems like Kafka
🔹 This prevents one stage (like ingestion) from blocking another (like transformation).

Horizontal Scaling
Instead of scaling vertically (adding more CPU to one server), I prefer horizontal scaling — adding more nodes or containers

Optimize Data Processing
I use partitioning, caching, and parallel I/O to speed up large data transformations.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):
Data is first extracted from source systems, transformed into the required format on a separate processing server or ETL tool, and then loaded into the data warehouse.

ELT (Extract, Load, Transform):
Data is first extracted and loaded directly into the target data warehouse (often cloud-based), and the transformation happens inside the data warehouse using its processing power.

| Feature                     | ETL                                       | ELT                                                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Transformation Location** | Before loading (external ETL tool/server) | After loading (inside target DB)                       |
| **Best for**                | On-premises data warehouses               | Cloud-based warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) |
| **Performance**             | Limited by ETL server                     | Uses data warehouse’s high scalability                 |
| **Data Volume**             | Moderate                                  | Large/Big Data                                         |
| **Latency**                 | Batch processing                          | Near real-time or flexible processing                  |

Use ELT when:
You need to load large volumes of raw data quickly.
You want more flexibility for data analysts to run transformations on demand.

Use ETL when:
You need complex transformations before loading data.
The target system has limited processing capacity.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Z-Ordering in Delta Lake is an optimization that reorders data within partitions based on multiple columns, improving data skipping and query performance.
For example, if my table is partitioned by date but queries often filter by customer_id, I can run OPTIMIZE table ZORDER BY (customer_id) to cluster related records together.
This way, Spark reads fewer files for those queries
Z-Ordering is especially useful for frequent filters on non-partition columns, multi-dimensional queries, and join keys, reducing I/O and improving performance significantly.”
Before Z-Order:
Files have random customer_id values → Spark scans many files.
After Z-Order:
Each file contains a narrow range of customer_id values → Spark skips irrelevant files easily.

⚖️ 6️⃣ Performance Impact
Z-Ordering reduces the number of files read by Spark.

OPTIMIZE sales_table
Z-Ordering uses a multi-dimensional clustering technique
ZORDER BY (customer_id, product_id);
Under the hood:
Delta Lake combines files within each partition.
Then it reorders records based on the Z-order curve of the specified columns.
The reordered files make data skipping more effective.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T — Time Travel (Data Versioning)
Delta automatically versions your table after every transaction (in _delta_log).
You can query older versions of your data using a timestamp or version number.
spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 5).load("/delta/sales")
This feature allows rollback to previous versions

Schema Evolution:
Delta enforces a consistent schema between writes.
If new data doesn’t match the existing schema, Spark throws an error unless schema evolution is explicitly allowed.
Example:
spark.conf.set("spark.databricks.delta.schema.autoMerge.enabled", "true")
Delta prevents accidental data corruption by enforcing schema consistency — you can’t write mismatched columns or types.
But if needed, Delta supports schema evolution for adding new columns

_______________________________________
Data skew happens when some partitions in a Spark job have significantly more data than others.
a few tasks take much longer while others finish quickly, leading to poor parallelism and slower job execution
Let’s say you’re joining on customer_id, and one customer (say ID = 12345) has millions of records, while others have only a few.

Why Does Data Skew Happen
Few dominant values in the key column.
Improper partitioning of data


🚀 4️⃣ Strategies to Resolve Data Skew
from pyspark.sql import functions as F
# Add random salt to skewed key
salted_df = df.withColumn("salted_key", 
                          F.concat(F.col("customer_id"), F.lit("_"), (F.rand()*5).cast("int")))
# Join using salted key
result = salted_df.join(other_df, salted_df.salted_key == other_df.salted_key)
“I used key salting to distribute skewed keys across multiple partitions.
By adding a random salt, the heavy key gets split into smaller groups, balancing the workload.”

Avoid shuffle altogether by broadcasting the smaller dataset to all executors.
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
result = large_df.join(broadcast(small_df), "customer_id")
“Instead of shuffling both datasets, I broadcast the smaller one to every node — this prevents skew from large shuffle operations




____________________________________________________________________________
REPARTITION
repartition() increases or decreases the number of partitions by shuffling all the data across the cluster.
How it works:
Performs a full shuffle — data is redistributed across all partitions.
Each partition gets a roughly equal amount of data.
Can increase or decrease partitions.
Creates new partitions from scratch

When to use:
When you increase partitions to improve parallelism.
When you want even data distribution across partitions (to avoid skew).
performing a wide transformation (like join or groupBy).

⚙️ 2️⃣ COALESCE
How it works:
Narrow transformation — it simply merges adjacent partitions.
No shuffle, so it’s much faster than repartition.
Can only decrease the number of partitions

when to use
., before writing output files
fewer output files

| Feature                 | `repartition()`                | `coalesce()`             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Shuffle**             | Yes (full shuffle)             | No shuffle               |
| **Performance**         | Slower (due to shuffle)        | Faster (no shuffle)      |
| **Use case**            | Increase or balance partitions | Decrease partitions      |
| **Transformation type** | Wide transformation            | Narrow transformation    |
| **Data distribution**   | More balanced                  | May be uneven            |
| **Flexibility**         | Can increase or decrease       | Only decrease            |
| **Fault tolerance**     | Higher                         | Lower (since no shuffle) |

how i coalesce does not do shuffle but repartion do

shuffling means moving data between executors or partitions across the cluster — it’s expensive because it involves:
writing data to disk,
sending it over the network

Spark does not move data across executors.
Instead, it reuses existing partitions and merges adjacent partitions into fewer ones.
Spark just combines partition 1+2 and partition 3+4 — without redistributing data.
So:
No network I/O
No shuffle

repartition() Works Internally
Redistribute all records evenly across the 8 partitions.
Data from every old partition can go to any new partition.
This ensures balanced data distribution and parallelism

_____________________________________________________________________
how Spark executes tasks in DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) format

When we submit a Spark job, Spark first builds a logical plan of transformations.
Then, it converts this into a physical plan called a DAG — a Directed Acyclic Graph — that represents stages separated by shuffle boundaries.
Each stage is further divided into tasks based on partitions.
The DAG Scheduler submits these stages to the Task Scheduler, which runs the tasks on executors across the cluster.
Once all stages complete successfully, the job result is returned

DAG Scheduler: Divides the job into stages and creates the DAG.
Task Scheduler: Schedules tasks to executors.
Executor: Executes tasks and returns results.
Cluster Manager (like YARN, Mesos, or Standalone): Allocates resources.

Each node in the DAG represents a RDD/DataFrame.
Each edge represents a transformation (like map, filter, join, etc.).
No cycles — because once data is processed, Spark doesn’t go back.
Spark divides transformations into two types:
Narrow transformations: (e.g., map, filter) → data from one partition goes to one partition (no shuffle).
Wide transformations: (e.g., groupBy, join) → data needs to be shuffled across nodes.
When Spark detects a wide transformation, it creates a new stage in the DAG.
“Spark breaks the job into stages based on shuffle boundaries and forms a DAG of stages.”
_____________________________________________
Spark Core is the general execution engine for the Spark platform, responsible for tasks such 
as scheduling, distributing, and monitoring applications.
SparkContext is the entry point for any Spark application. It acts as a connection to the 
Spark cluster, allowing Spark jobs to be executed.

SparkSession is the unified entry point to work with DataFrames, Datasets, and SQL in 
Apache Spark. It replaces SQLContext and HiveContex

Excellent question, Ashish 👏 — this is **one of the most frequently asked Spark fundamentals** in interviews (especially for data engineering or Spark developer roles).

Let’s break it down clearly — **definitions + examples + how they are related internally + a comparison table** 👇

---

## ⚙️ **1️⃣ Executor**

* **Definition:**
  Executors are **JVM processes** launched on worker nodes in a Spark cluster that actually **run the tasks** of your Spark job.
  They are responsible for:

  * Executing your code (tasks)
  * Storing data in memory/disk (for caching)
  * Returning results to the driver

* **Key points:**

  * Executors live as long as your Spark application runs.
  * Each executor can run **multiple tasks in parallel**, depending on the number of **cores** allocated to it.

* **Example:**
  If your Spark app has 4 executors and each has 4 cores →
  **Total 16 tasks can run in parallel.**

---

## 🧮 **2️⃣ Cores**

* **Definition:**
  Cores are the **processing units** (CPU threads) available to executors to run tasks in parallel.

* **Key points:**

  * Each core runs **one task at a time**.
  * More cores = more parallelism = faster execution (up to a point).

* **Example:**

  * Executor with 4 cores → can process 4 tasks simultaneously.
  * Cluster with 10 executors × 4 cores = 40 tasks parallel execution.

---

## 🧩 **3️⃣ Stage**

* **Definition:**
  A **stage** is a **set of parallel tasks** that execute the same computation (like a map or reduce) on different data partitions.

* **Created When:**
  Spark divides a job into stages **based on shuffle boundaries**.
  (A shuffle happens when data must be redistributed across the cluster — e.g., during `groupByKey`, `join`, or `reduceByKey`.)

* **Example:**

  ```python
  rdd.map(lambda x: (x,1)).reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a+b)
  ```

  * Stage 1 → Map stage
  * Stage 2 → Reduce stage (after shuffle)

---

## 🧱 **4️⃣ Job**

* **Definition:**
  A **job** is triggered whenever you perform an **action** (like `count()`, `collect()`, `saveAsTextFile()`, etc.) on an RDD or DataFrame.

* **Key points:**

  * One action → one job
  * A job is divided into one or more stages
  * Each stage has multiple parallel tasks

* **Example:**

  ```python
  df.count()
  df.show()
  ```

  → Each of these actions will trigger a **separate Spark job**

---

## 🔄 **5️⃣ Transformation**

* **Definition:**
  Transformations are operations on RDDs or DataFrames that **define a new dataset** from an existing one.
  They are **lazy** — Spark does not execute them immediately; it builds a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead.

* **Types:**

  * **Narrow transformations:** No shuffle (e.g., `map`, `filter`)
  * **Wide transformations:** Causes shuffle (e.g., `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`)

* **Example:**

  ```python
  rdd2 = rdd1.map(lambda x: x*2)
  rdd3 = rdd2.filter(lambda x: x > 10)
  ```

  No computation happens yet — Spark just builds the DAG.

---

## ⚡ **6️⃣ Action**

* **Definition:**
  Actions **trigger execution** of the DAG built by transformations.
  They tell Spark to **actually perform the computation** and return a result to the driver or write to storage.

* **Example:**

  ```python
  rdd3.count()          # Returns number of elements
  rdd3.collect()        # Returns all elements to driver
  rdd3.saveAsTextFile() # Writes to storage
  ```

  Once you call an action → Spark starts executing stages → tasks → on executors.

---

## 🔗 **7️⃣ Relationship Between All Components**

```

   ↓
Transformations build DAG
   ↓
Action triggers a Job
   ↓
Job is split into Stages
   ↓
Each Stage has multiple Tasks
   ↓
Tasks are executed in parallel on Executors

Described the hybrid approach of maintaining a current data table and a historical changes table.

In data warehousing, a hybrid approach combines the benefits of real-time updates and full historical tracking.
We maintain two tables — one for current data and one for historical changes.

When an update happens, the old record is moved to the history table with effective start and end dates, and the current table is updated with the new value.
In Current Table, we update:

Customer_ID | Name   | Address | IsActive
-----------------------------------------
101          | Rajesh | Mumbai  | Y


✅ In History Table, we insert the old record:

Customer_ID | Old_Address | Effective_Start | Effective_End | IsActive
---------------------------------------------------------------------
101          | Delhi       | 2024-01-01      | 2025-01-15     | N

| **Type 1 – Overwrite**      | Old data is replaced by new data; no history maintained.                                                    | Customer’s old address replaced by new one.                                                                              |
| **Type 2 – New Record**     | A new record is created when data changes; full history preserved with effective dates or flags.            | Product’s price change creates a new record with new `start_date` and `end_date`.                                        |
| **Type 3 – New Column**     | Adds a new column to store the previous value; only one level of history retained.                          | Employee’s previous role stored in “Previous_Role” column.                                                               |
| **Type 4 – History Table**  | Separate history table maintains old records; main table holds current data.                                | Old store details pushed to “Store_History” table when location changes.                                                 |
| **Type 6 – Hybrid (1+2+3)** | Combination of Types 1, 2, and 3 — overwriting, adding new records, and tracking previous columns together. | Salesperson changes region → new record (Type 2), previous region column updated (Type 3), contact overwritten (Type 1). |

FACT vs DIM

A fact table is the central table in a data warehouse that stores measurable data — things you can count or sum, such as sales amount, units sold, or revenue.
It answers what happened in the business, while dimension tables explain who, what, when, and where.
For example, in a retail business, the fact table might have columns like Product_ID, Store_ID, Date_ID, and measures such as Units_Sold and Revenue. 
These foreign keys link to dimensions for deeper analysis.

There are three main types:
Transactional — records every individual event, like each sale.
Snapshot — captures the state at regular intervals, like daily inventory.
Accumulating — tracks progress of a process, like order to delivery.
Accumulating fact table — tracks processes with defined start and end points, such as an order from booking to delivery


A dimension table contains descriptive attributes about business entities — like products, customers, stores, or dates.
It provides context to the numbers in a fact table, answering the who, what, where, when of a business event.
It gives context to the numbers in a fact table
For example, instead of seeing just Product_ID = 101, the dimension table tells you that it’s “iPhone 15”, belongs to the “Smartphones” category, and is made by “Apple”.


| **Feature**           | **Fact Table**                                                          | **Dimension Table**                                                          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**           | Stores measurable, quantitative business data (facts or metrics).       | Stores descriptive, contextual information about business entities.          |
| **Type of Data**      | Numeric data (e.g., sales amount, quantity, profit).                    | Text or descriptive data (e.g., product name, customer name, location).      |
| **Foreign Key**       | Contains foreign keys referencing dimension tables.                     | Does **not** contain foreign keys from fact tables (only primary key).       |
| **Operations**        | Used for aggregations like SUM, AVG, COUNT during analysis.             | Used for filtering, grouping, and labeling facts in reports.                 |
| **Size**              | Usually very large (millions or billions of records).                   | Smaller in size compared to fact tables.                                     |
| **Refresh Frequency** | Updated frequently (as new transactions occur).                         | Changes rarely — mostly when entity attributes change.                       |
| **Example**           | Sales_Fact (Date_ID, Product_ID, Customer_ID, Units_Sold, Revenue).     | Product_Dim (Product_ID, Product_Name, Category, Brand, Price).              |

An index is a database structure (like a lookup table) that helps the database find rows faster without scanning the entire table.
Think of it like an index in a book — it points you to the page where information is located instead of reading every page.
Without an index → Database performs a full table scan (checks every row).
With an index → Database uses the index to quickly locate rows matching the condition.

Internally, traditional databases implement indexes using data structures like B-trees or hash tables.
A B-tree index maintains sorted keys and pointers to rows, allowing logarithmic time lookups.
Each insert or update operation must also maintain this index structure, which is why indexes speed up reads but can slow down writes
When you insert, update, or delete rows:
The DB must also update the index structure.
This is why write-heavy tables can get slower with too many indexes.
The indexed key is passed through a hash function.
The function returns a hash value that points directly to the data location.
Lookup time is O(1) on average (very fast for equality searches

| Question                                                | Answer  | Explanation                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval.        | ✅ True  | Indexes make searches faster by avoiding full table scans.      |
| 2️⃣ Indexes slow down data insertion and updates.       | ✅ True  | Because the index must be updated whenever data changes.        |
| 3️⃣ You can create an index on multiple columns.        | ✅ True  | That’s called a **composite index**.                            |
| 4️⃣ Indexes reduce storage space.                       | ❌ False | They actually **consume extra space** in the database.          |
| 5️⃣ Indexes are automatically created on every column.  | ❌ False | You must explicitly create them (except for primary keys).      |
| 6️⃣ A primary key automatically creates a unique index. | ✅ True  | Most databases do this under the hood.                          |
| 7️⃣ Too many indexes always improve performance.        | ❌ False | Too many indexes can **slow down writes** and use extra memory. |

WINDOW Functions:  Provided use cases for RANK(), DENSE_RANK() for ordering data within partitions

Window functions are used to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row —
without collapsing them into a single result like aggregation does

RANK() gives the same rank to ties, but skips the next number (notice both 400’s get rank 1, and the next rank would be 3).
DENSE_RANK() does not skip ranks after a tie.
So if two rows share rank 1, the next is 2 (not 3).





_______________________________________________________________________________________

SELF JOIN Applications:  Discussed scenarios like finding manager-employee relationships within the same table

A SELF JOIN is when a table is joined to itself —
you treat the same table as two different tables using aliases.
This is useful when rows within the same table are related to each other — for example:

SELECT 
    e.emp_name AS employee,
    m.emp_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;

HAVING vs WHERE:  Explained how WHERE filters rows before aggregation, whereas HAVING filters groups post-aggregation
explain this 

WHERE is used to filter individual rows before any grouping or aggregation happens.
HAVING is used to filter aggregated results after GROUP BY has been applied.

Both Delta Lake and Parquet are file formats used in data lakes, but they serve different purposes.
Parquet is a storage format, while Delta is a storage layer built on top of Parquet that adds reliability, transaction support, and versioning

Parquet – Data Storage Format
Parquet is a columnar storage format.
It’s highly efficient for read-heavy analytics workloads.
It supports compression and encoding schemes for better performance.
However, it is immutable — once written, you can’t easily update or delete records.
It lacks ACID transactions and data versioning.
✅ Example use case: Great for storing large, append-only datasets for analytics (like logs or historical data).


| Feature            | Parquet              | Delta Lake                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Storage Type       | Columnar file format | Storage layer built on Parquet       |
| ACID Transactions  | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Schema Enforcement | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Updates/Deletes    | ❌ Hard               | ✅ Supported                          |
| Time Travel        | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Streaming Support  | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Metadata Handling  | Hive Metastore       | Delta transaction log (`_delta_log`) |
| Use Case           | Raw data storage     | Reliable data lake / Lakehouse       |

______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that sits on top of Parquet files.
It adds features that Parquet alone doesn’t provide, such as:
ACID transactions (ensures reliability during concurrent writes)
Schema evolution and enforcement
Time travel (query old versions of data)
Merge, update, delete support
Streaming + batch unification
