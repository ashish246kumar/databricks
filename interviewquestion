An index is a database structure (like a lookup table) that helps the database find rows faster without scanning the entire table.
Think of it like an index in a book — it points you to the page where information is located instead of reading every page.
Without an index → Database performs a full table scan (checks every row).
With an index → Database uses the index to quickly locate rows matching the condition.

Internally, traditional databases implement indexes using data structures like B-trees or hash tables.
A B-tree index maintains sorted keys and pointers to rows, allowing logarithmic time lookups.
Each insert or update operation must also maintain this index structure, which is why indexes speed up reads but can slow down writes
When you insert, update, or delete rows:
The DB must also update the index structure.
This is why write-heavy tables can get slower with too many indexes.
The indexed key is passed through a hash function.
The function returns a hash value that points directly to the data location.
Lookup time is O(1) on average (very fast for equality searches

| Question                                                | Answer  | Explanation                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval.        | ✅ True  | Indexes make searches faster by avoiding full table scans.      |
| 2️⃣ Indexes slow down data insertion and updates.       | ✅ True  | Because the index must be updated whenever data changes.        |
| 3️⃣ You can create an index on multiple columns.        | ✅ True  | That’s called a **composite index**.                            |
| 4️⃣ Indexes reduce storage space.                       | ❌ False | They actually **consume extra space** in the database.          |
| 5️⃣ Indexes are automatically created on every column.  | ❌ False | You must explicitly create them (except for primary keys).      |
| 6️⃣ A primary key automatically creates a unique index. | ✅ True  | Most databases do this under the hood.                          |
| 7️⃣ Too many indexes always improve performance.        | ❌ False | Too many indexes can **slow down writes** and use extra memory. |

WINDOW Functions:  Provided use cases for RANK(), DENSE_RANK() for ordering data within partitions

Window functions are used to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row —
without collapsing them into a single result like aggregation does

RANK() gives the same rank to ties, but skips the next number (notice both 400’s get rank 1, and the next rank would be 3).
DENSE_RANK() does not skip ranks after a tie.
So if two rows share rank 1, the next is 2 (not 3).

SELF JOIN Applications:  Discussed scenarios like finding manager-employee relationships within the same table

A SELF JOIN is when a table is joined to itself —
you treat the same table as two different tables using aliases.
This is useful when rows within the same table are related to each other — for example:

SELECT 
    e.emp_name AS employee,
    m.emp_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;

HAVING vs WHERE:  Explained how WHERE filters rows before aggregation, whereas HAVING filters groups post-aggregation
explain this 

WHERE is used to filter individual rows before any grouping or aggregation happens.
HAVING is used to filter aggregated results after GROUP BY has been applied.

Both Delta Lake and Parquet are file formats used in data lakes, but they serve different purposes.
Parquet is a storage format, while Delta is a storage layer built on top of Parquet that adds reliability, transaction support, and versioning

Parquet – Data Storage Format
Parquet is a columnar storage format.
It’s highly efficient for read-heavy analytics workloads.
It supports compression and encoding schemes for better performance.
However, it is immutable — once written, you can’t easily update or delete records.
It lacks ACID transactions and data versioning.
✅ Example use case: Great for storing large, append-only datasets for analytics (like logs or historical data).


| Feature            | Parquet              | Delta Lake                           |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Storage Type       | Columnar file format | Storage layer built on Parquet       |
| ACID Transactions  | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Schema Enforcement | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Updates/Deletes    | ❌ Hard               | ✅ Supported                          |
| Time Travel        | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Streaming Support  | ❌ No                 | ✅ Yes                                |
| Metadata Handling  | Hive Metastore       | Delta transaction log (`_delta_log`) |
| Use Case           | Raw data storage     | Reliable data lake / Lakehouse       |

Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that sits on top of Parquet files.
It adds features that Parquet alone doesn’t provide, such as:
ACID transactions (ensures reliability during concurrent writes)
Schema evolution and enforcement
Time travel (query old versions of data)
Merge, update, delete support
Streaming + batch unification
