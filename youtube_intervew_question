Question: How does Spark work? Can you quickly guide me through the Spark architecture? [00:01]

Answer: When you write a Spark application, the driver program gets executed. It follows several steps:
Schema Validation: It checks if the code is syntactically correct and matches the schema catalog. [00:15]
Unresolved Logical Plan: Once validated, it creates an unresolved logical plan. [00:26]
Logical Plan: A logical plan is created with the help of the Catalyst Optimizer, considering cost and roles. [00:39]
Physical Plan: Finally, a physical plan is created and then used for execution. [00:

Question: What exactly is the difference between submitting a job in client mode or in cluster mode in Spark? [00:01]

Answer: - Client Mode: The driver program runs on the client machine [00:09]. This mode allows for interaction with the cluster results 
and is primarily used for development purposes, as it makes it easy to see the execution results from the cluster. [00:15]

Cluster Mode: The driver program runs on the cluster itself [00:25]. This mode is most commonly used for production environments. [00:31]
