spark overview 

**What is Apache Spark?**
Video mein definition di gayi hai: "Apache Spark is a unified computing engine and set of libraries for parallel data processing on a computer cluster". Is definition ko samajhne ke liye YouTuber ne har term ko explain kiya hai:

**1. Unified**
*   **Explanation:** Unified ka matlab hota hai "sab cheez ko ek jagah la dena."
*   **Example:** Video mein example diya hai ki Data Engineer (pipeline banane wala), Data Analyst (sales analysis karne wala), aur Data Scientist (future predict karne wala)—agar ye teeno "ek hi software ya ek hi jagah pe kaam kar sakte hain, toh usi ko bolte hain Unified." Spark mein ye sab log ek hi computing engine par kaam kar sakte hain,.

**2. Computing Engine**
*   **Explanation:** Spark data ko store nahi karta hai. "Basically ye sara cheez RAM mein ho raha hota hai," jo ki permanent storage nahi hai.
*   **Example:** Jaise hamare laptop mein CPU task perform karta hai. Example diya ki "2+5 = 7... ye humein jo compute karne wali cheez hai wo kaun dega? Wo humein dega Spark." Agar 5 Terabyte ka data hai aur usme +1 karna hai, toh wo Spark compute karega. Storage ke liye S3, HDFS, ya RDBMS use hota hai kyunki Spark ke paas storage nahi hota,.

**3. Set of Libraries**
*   **Explanation:** Ye "set of code hota hai jo ki humein likh kar de diye jaate hain."
*   **Example:** Jaise aapne "Pandas" suna hoga, waise hi Spark mein libraries hoti hain jiska use karke hum aage ke kaam perform karte hain.

**4. Parallel Data Processing**
*   **Explanation:** Ek task ko multiple logon mein divide karke karwana.
*   **The Father-Son Example:** Yahan ek example explain kiya hai: "Maan lo ki ek baap hai, uske char bete hain. Ab baap ke paas total 10 task hain... toh wo kya karega do-do ya teen-teen task de dega do beton ko." Is tarah 10 task char beton mein divide ho gaye. "Charon bete apne apne independent task karenge aur shaam ko aakar result de denge." Agar baap akele karta toh time lagta, par beton ne mil kar jaldi kar diya. Same cheez Spark mein hoti hai jahan task alag-alag executors par bhej diya jata hai,.

**5. Computer Cluster**
*   **Explanation:** Spark "Master-Slave architecture" par kaam karta hai. "Ek machine jo ban gaya wo Master ban gaya aur baaki sare jo machines hain wo hamare ban gaye Slave (naukar)."
*   **Architecture Example:** Video mein assume kiya hai ki har computer (worker) ke paas "16GB ka RAM hai aur 1 Terabyte ka storage hai aur 4 core CPU hai."
*   **Process:** Agar Master ko 5 Terabyte data process karna hai, toh wo dekhega ki workers ke paas kitni capacity hai (jaise total 64GB ek baar mein). Master ka kaam hai data ko divide karna aur workers se kaam karwana,,.

Finally, video mein kaha gaya hai ki Spark ek "Unified Computing Engine hai... yaad rakhna storage nahi hota iske paas" aur ye parallel data processing karta hai computer clusters par.

Spark SQL Engine
In this lecture (Lec-8), Manish Kumar explains the Spark SQL Engine (also known as the Catalyst Optimizer) and the four phases it uses to convert high-level Spark code (SQL, DataFrames, or DataSets) into low-level Java bytecode for execution on a cluster.

1. The Spark SQL Engine Flow
The video breaks down the conversion of your code into the following four sequential phases:

Phase 1: Analysis & The Catalog [07:27]
When you write a query, Spark first creates an Unresolved Logical Plan.
It then uses the Catalog (a repository of metadata like table names, column types, and file locations) to verify if the tables or columns you referenced actually exist.
If a column or table is missing, Spark throws an Analysis Exception at this stage [09:13].

Phase 2: Logical Planning / Optimization [10:35]
Once the plan is resolved, Spark applies logical optimizations.
Example: If you write SELECT * but only use two columns later, Spark optimizes the plan to fetch only those two specific columns from the source to save network bandwidth. It also combines multiple filter transformations into one [11:42].

Phase 3: Physical Planning [12:37]
Spark takes the optimized logical plan and generates multiple Physical Plans.
It uses a Cost-Based Model to evaluate these plans. It calculates which plan will use the least amount of CPU and memory.
Example: It decides whether to perform a Broadcast Join (sending a small table to all executors) or a standard shuffle join based on table sizes to avoid expensive data shuffling [12:54].
The best performing plan is selected as the Selected Physical Plan.

Phase 4: Code Generation [06:17]
The final physical plan consists of RDD transformations. Spark uses Whole-Stage Code Generation to convert these into highly optimized Java bytecode that runs on the cluster's executors [14:50].

2. Key Interview Questions Answered [01:40]
What is the Catalyst Optimizer? It is the engine that converts your high-level code into an optimized physical execution plan.
Why do we get an Analysis Exception? This occurs during the first phase if the metadata (table/column names) doesn't match the Catalog [10:06].
What is the Catalog? It is a storage for metadata (data about data), such as file sizes and schema information [08:17].
Is Spark SQL Engine a compiler? Yes, because it ultimately translates high-level Spark code into Java bytecode for the machine to execute [16:39].

3. Example: Analysis Error [09:19]
Manish shows a code snippet where he tries to select a column named name1 from a JSON file, but the actual column name is name. Because the Catalyst Optimizer checks the Catalog during the Analysis phase and finds no match, it throws an error immediately before any data is even processed._______________________________________________________________________
Database vs datalake vs data warehouse
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
. Core Concepts Explained
Database (OLTP):

Purpose: Primarily used for day-to-day transactions (Online Transactional Processing). It focuses on high performance for immediate tasks [01:33].
Data Type: Deals only with structured data (rows and columns) [02:43].
Recent Data: It holds only recent data (e.g., last 5-6 months) to maintain speed; it cannot efficiently store years of historical data [03:12].
Schema: Uses Schema on Write, meaning the structure is validated before data is saved. Any mismatch results in an error during the writing process [04:18].

Cost: The storage cost is high [06:23].
Data Warehouse (OLAP):
Purpose: Used for analytical processing (Online Analytical Processing) and finding insights from large amounts of historical data [07:51].
Source: It aggregates data from multiple databases through an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process [14:52].
Schema: Like a database, it uses Schema on Write and deals with structured data [12:41].
Cost: Storage is expensive, though generally cheaper than a primary transactional database [13:16].

Data Lake:
Purpose: Meant to store huge amounts of raw data for later analysis. It offers maximum flexibility for various teams to use the data as they need [18:04].
Data Type: Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (like log files or docs) in its original form [17:56].
Process: Uses ELT (Extract, Load, Transform). Data is loaded first, and transformations happen only when the data is read [19:00].
Schema: Uses Schema on Read, allowing users to define the structure at the time of analysis [21:01].
Cost: Highly cost-effective as it uses cheap storage hardware [20:16].

2. Examples Provided
Database Example:
Scenario: Swiping your card at an ATM or purchasing an item on Amazon. These are instant transactions where your current balance must be updated immediately [01:16].
Systems: Oracle, MySQL [04:06].
Data Warehouse Example:
Scenario: Amazon analysts wanting to see your purchase trends over the last 10 years to find insights. They move data from the transactional database to a warehouse to run complex queries without slowing down the main site [08:15].
Systems: Teradata [13:16].
Data Lake Example:
Scenario: Storing a raw .csv or log file. You load the file into the system as-is and later create a structure (like a Hive table) on top of it to visualize the data [21:10].
Systems: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), Amazon S3 [19
__________________________________________________________
difference between Partitioning and Bucketing
Partitioning:
How it works: It divides data into multiple folders based on a specific column [03:02].
When to use: Use it when a column has low cardinality (limited distinct values), such as Country or Date [04:10].
Benefit: When you query for a specific value (e.g., Country = 'India'), the system only scans that specific folder instead of the entire dataset [03:21].

Bucketing:
How it works: It divides data into a fixed number of files using a hash function [06:21].
When to use: Use it when a column has high cardinality (many unique values), such as Customer ID or Zip Code [05:44].
Benefit: It distributes data evenly across a specified number of buckets (files) to manage large volumes of data that partitioning alone cannot handle efficiently [07:31].

2. Examples Provided
Partitioning Example [01:43]
Scenario: You have a table with billions of records including a Country column.
The Query: SELECT * FROM table WHERE Country = 'India'.
The Process: * Without partitioning, the system scans all 100 billion records.
With partitioning by Country, the system creates separate folders for India, USA, and UK.
The query goes directly to the India folder, drastically increasing speed [03:02].

Bucketing Example [06:41]
Scenario: You want to organize data by Customer ID (which has millions of unique values).
The Process:
You decide to create 4 buckets.
The system uses a hash function: Customer ID % 4.
If the result is 0, the data goes to Bucket 1; if it's 1, it goes to Bucket 2, and so on [07:07].
This results in exactly 4 files regardless of how many unique Customer IDs exist [07:17].


Partitioning:
SQL
CREATE TABLE zip_codes (...)
PARTITIONED BY (state STRING);
Bucketing:

SQL
CREATE TABLE zip_codes (...)
CLUSTERED BY (zip_code) INTO 10 BUCKETS;

What are the differences between Managed Identity and Service Principal, and when should each be used?

Answer: * Managed Identity: * What it is: An identity automatically created and managed by Azure for specific resources
(like Azure Data Factory). [03:15, 01:10:35] * When to use: Use it whenever possible (recommended by Microsoft) 
for authenticating between Azure resources that support it. [13:18] * Advantages: It is highly secure and easy to manage because Azure handles the credentials,
removing the need for manual key rotation. [11:09, 11:18] * Disadvantages: It is less flexible because users have little control over its configuration, 
and it is not supported by all services (e.g., Azure DevOps). [12:31, 07:54]

Service Principal:

What it is: A security identity used by applications, services, and automation tools (created via Azure Entra ID/Active Directory) to access specific Azure resources. [03:51, 10:45]
When to use: Use it when Managed Identity is not supported, or when an external service (like Azure DevOps) needs to access Azure resources. [13:43, 07:39]
Advantages: It is highly flexible; you can create as many as needed and use them across various internal and external services. [12:49, 12:56]
Disadvantages: It is less secure and harder to manage because you must manually handle credentials (secret keys) and rotate them before they expire. [11:35, 11:55]

(
Azure services:

Managed Identity Example (ADF to Databricks):

When you create Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure automatically creates an identity for it.

To give ADF access to Azure Databricks, you simply go to the Databricks access control and select the "Managed Identity" of that specific Data Factory.

Service Principal Example (Azure DevOps to Databricks):

If you want to use Azure DevOps to run a CI/CD pipeline in Databricks, you cannot use a Managed Identity because Azure DevOps doesn't have one in the same way.

Instead, you must create a "third-party" ID called a Service Principal in Azure Entra ID (Active Directory).

You generate a Client ID and a Secret Key for this Service Principal and then provide those credentials to Azure DevOps so it can "log in" and perform tasks in Databricks

copying billion rows from a file to a database and identifies lines that are causing the problem. 
He suggests that the solution is to enable fault tolerance in the copy activity settings and check the "skip the incompatible rows" option. 
This will allow the compatible rows to be pushed into the database, while the incompatible rows can be found in the log

Edge Node (Gateway Node): 
An isolated machine outside the main cluster used for submitting Spark jobs. It serves security and organizational purposes:
Prevents direct user access to the cluster to avoid manual data corruption or security risks.
Handles authentication and authorization (e.g., via Kerberos) before jobs are submitted
Deployment Modes: The mode is determined by where the driver program runs.

Client Mode:
The driver runs on the edge node (client machine).
Logs are displayed directly on the user's screen, making it ideal for development and debugging.
Disadvantage: Higher network latency due to two-way communication between the edge node and the cluster.
Disadvantage: If the edge node is shut down or disconnected, the driver dies, and all executors are killed, stopping the process.

Cluster Mode:
The driver runs on one of the worker nodes inside the cluster.
Recommended for production workloads.
Advantage: Lower network latency since the driver and executors are within the same cluster.
Advantage: The edge node can be disconnected after submission without affecting the job, as the driver is already running in the cluster.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Question: How does Spark work? Can you quickly guide me through the Spark architecture? [00:01]

Answer: When you write a Spark application, the driver program gets executed. It follows several steps:
Schema Validation: It checks if the code is syntactically correct and matches the schema catalog. [00:15]
Unresolved Logical Plan: Once validated, it creates an unresolved logical plan. [00:26]
Logical Plan: A logical plan is created with the help of the Catalyst Optimizer, considering cost and roles. [00:39]
Physical Plan: Finally, a physical plan is created and then used for execution. [00:
______________________________________________________________
Question: What exactly is the difference between submitting a job in client mode or in cluster mode in Spark? [00:01]

Answer: - Client Mode: The driver program runs on the client machine [00:09]. This mode allows for interaction with the cluster results 
and is primarily used for development purposes, as it makes it easy to see the execution results from the cluster. [00:15]

Cluster Mode: The driver program runs on the cluster itself [00:25]. This mode is most commonly used for production environments. [00:31]
