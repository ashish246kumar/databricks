1️⃣ Data Lake (Traditional Data Lake)
What it is

A storage architecture that stores raw data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) at large scale, usually on low-cost object storage.

Examples

AWS S3

Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)

Google Cloud Storage

Key Characteristics

Stores data as-is (raw, curated, aggregated)

Supports schema-on-read

Cheap and scalable

No inherent transaction support

❌ Limitations

❌ No ACID transactions

❌ Data quality issues (duplicate, corrupt data)

❌ Schema drift is unmanaged

❌ Difficult updates/deletes

❌ Concurrency issues

Interview One-liner

“A data lake is cheap and scalable storage, but without transactional guarantees or built-in reliability.”

2️⃣ Delta Lake
What it is

A storage layer on top of a data lake that adds reliability and performance using transaction logs.

👉 Delta Lake does not replace the data lake — it enhances it.

What Delta Lake Adds (This is critical)

✅ ACID transactions

✅ Schema enforcement & evolution

✅ Time travel (versioning)

✅ Upserts / Deletes / MERGE

✅ Concurrent reads & writes

✅ Data reliability

How it works (Important Interview Detail)

Stores data as Parquet files

Maintains a _delta_log transaction log

Every operation is recorded as a transaction

Problems it Solves
Problem in Data Lake	Delta Lake Solution
Partial writes	Atomic commits
Dirty reads	Snapshot isolation
Duplicate ingestion	MERGE
Schema drift	Enforced schemas
Debugging	Time travel
Interview One-liner

“Delta Lake brings database-like reliability to a data lake using ACID transactions and a transaction log.”

3️⃣ DLT (Delta Live Tables)
What it is

A managed pipeline framework built on top of Delta Lake for ETL/ELT automation.

Think of it as:

Delta Lake + Pipeline orchestration + Data quality + Monitoring

What DLT Does (Very Important)

Declarative pipeline definitions

Automatic dependency management

Built-in data quality checks

Automatic retries & recovery

Pipeline monitoring & lineage

Key Concepts

Live Tables – tables automatically updated

Streaming + Batch unified

Expectations – data quality rules

Materialized views

Example (DLT Expectation)
CONSTRAINT valid_amount EXPECT (order_amount > 0) ON VIOLATION DROP ROW

❌ What DLT is NOT

❌ Not a storage layer

❌ Not a replacement for Spark

❌ Not just SQL — it’s a pipeline framework

Interview One-liner

“DLT is a managed ETL framework that uses Delta Lake to build reliable, observable, and quality-driven data pipelin

# **Apache Parquet – Interview Questions & Answers**

---

## **Q1. What is Parquet and why is it widely used in Data Engineering?**

**Answer:**
Parquet is a **columnar, binary file format** designed for **analytical workloads (OLAP)**.

It is widely used because:

* Data is written once and read many times
* Storage cost is reduced through compression
* Query performance is significantly faster than row-based formats

Parquet cannot be read directly using a text editor because it is a **binary format**.

---

## **Q2. What is the difference between row-based and column-based storage?**

**Answer:**

### **Row-Based Storage (CSV, Text)**

* Data is stored row by row
* Entire rows are read even if only one column is required
* Leads to unnecessary I/O
* Better suited for transactional systems (OLTP)

### **Column-Based Storage (Parquet)**

* Data is stored column by column
* Only required columns are read
* Reduces disk I/O and improves performance
* Ideal for analytical queries (OLAP)

---

## **Q3. Why is Parquet better for Big Data analytics?**

**Answer:**
In analytics, queries typically:

* Read only a few columns
* Scan large datasets

Parquet allows:

* Reading only required columns (**projection pruning**)
* Skipping irrelevant data using metadata (**predicate pushdown**)
* Faster query execution with lower storage cost

---

## **Q4. What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP systems, and how does Parquet fit in?**

**Answer:**

| Feature        | OLTP                   | OLAP               |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| Purpose        | Transactions           | Analytics          |
| Operations     | Insert, Update, Delete | Select, Aggregate  |
| Data Access    | Full row               | Few columns        |
| Storage Format | Row-based              | Columnar (Parquet) |

Parquet is designed for **OLAP systems**, not OLTP systems.

---

## **Q5. Is Parquet purely columnar? Explain its internal structure.**

**Answer:**
Parquet uses a **hybrid storage model**.

### **File Structure:**

1. **File** – The main container
2. **Row Groups** – Horizontal partitions of data

   * Default size is **128 MB**
   * Contains a subset of rows
3. **Column Chunks** – Column-wise storage inside a row group
4. **Pages** – Actual data storage units

   * Each page contains metadata (min, max, count)

This hybrid approach avoids excessive column jumping and improves performance.

---

## **Q6. What are Row Groups in Parquet and why are they important?**

**Answer:**
Row Groups are **horizontal partitions** of data.

Benefits:

* Allow partial file reads
* Enable skipping large chunks of data
* Improve performance during filtering
* Reduce disk I/O

Spark scans only the required row groups instead of the entire file.

---

## **Q7. What metadata does Parquet store?**

**Answer:**
Parquet is a **self-describing format**.

It stores metadata such as:

* Schema information
* Number of row groups
* Column statistics (min, max, null count)
* Encoding and compression details

This metadata is critical for query optimization.

---

## **Q8. How does Parquet reduce file size?**

**Answer:**
Parquet reduces file size using **encoding techniques** before applying compression.

### **1. Dictionary Encoding**

* Replaces repeated string values with integer keys
* Stores mapping in a dictionary

### **2. Run Length Encoding (RLE)**

* Compresses repeated values
* Example: `A, A, A, B, B` → `A3, B2`

### **3. Bit Packing**

* Stores small integers using fewer bits
* Avoids using 32 or 64 bits unnecessarily

After encoding, compression algorithms like **Snappy or Gzip** are applied.

---

## **Q9. What is Projection Pruning in Parquet?**

**Answer:**
Projection pruning means **reading only the columns required by the query**.

Example:

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees
```

Parquet reads only the `name` column and ignores all others.

This significantly reduces disk I/O.

---

## **Q10. What is Predicate Pushdown in Parquet?**

**Answer:**
Predicate pushdown allows Spark to **filter data at the storage level** using metadata.

Before reading data:

* Spark checks min/max values in row group metadata
* If the filter condition cannot be satisfied
* The entire row group is skipped

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE age < 18
```

If a row group has `min age = 22`, Spark skips it completely.

---

## **Q11. Why is Predicate Pushdown important?**

**Answer:**
Predicate pushdown:

* Avoids reading unnecessary data
* Saves disk I/O
* Improves query performance drastically
* Is one of the biggest advantages of Parquet

---

## **Q12. How does Parquet compare to CSV in performance?**

**Answer:**

| Aspect             | CSV       | Parquet       |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------- |
| Format             | Row-based | Columnar      |
| Compression        | Poor      | Excellent     |
| Metadata           | None      | Rich metadata |
| Predicate Pushdown | ❌         | ✅             |
| Projection Pruning | ❌         | ✅             |
| Performance        | Slow      | Very fast     |

Parquet queries can be **multiple times faster** than CSV.

---

## **Q13. Can Parquet be used without Spark?**

**Answer:**
Yes, Parquet can be read using:

* Spark
* Hive
* Presto
* Trino
* Impala

However, it **cannot be read using a text editor** due to its binary format.

---

## **Q14. When should Parquet NOT be used?**

**Answer:**
Parquet should not be used when:

* Data requires frequent updates or deletes
* Low-latency transactional workloads are needed
* OLTP systems are involved

---

## **Final Interview Tip**

Interviewers expect you to explain:

* **Why Parquet exists**
* **How it stores data**
* **How it optimizes queries**

A strong answer always connects:

> Columnar Storage → Metadata → Pruning → Performance

# **Apache Spark – Partitioning & Bucketing (Interview Q&A)**

---

## **Q1. What is partitioning in Spark?**

**Answer:**
Partitioning in Spark means **dividing data into separate directories based on the values of one or more columns**.

When we write data using `partitionBy`, Spark creates **folder structures** such as:

```
column=value
```

Each folder contains only the data belonging to that specific column value.

---

## **Q2. Why do we need partitioning?**

**Answer:**
Partitioning is mainly used for **read-time optimization**.

Since big data systems follow the **“Write Once, Read Many”** principle, partitioning helps:

* Reduce data scanning
* Improve query performance
* Enable **partition pruning**

---

## **Q3. How does partition pruning work?**

**Answer:**
Partition pruning means Spark reads **only the required partitions** instead of scanning the entire dataset.

Example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE address = 'India'
```

Spark directly reads:

```
address=India/
```

and ignores other folders like `address=USA` or `address=Japan`, resulting in faster queries.

---

## **Q4. How do you implement partitioning while writing a DataFrame?**

**Answer:**
Partitioning is implemented using the `partitionBy` method:

```python
df.write
  .partitionBy("address")
  .format("parquet")
  .save("path")
```

Spark creates separate folders for each distinct value in the `address` column.

---

## **Q5. Can we partition by multiple columns?**

**Answer:**
Yes, Spark supports **multi-level partitioning**.

Example:

```python
df.write
  .partitionBy("address", "gender")
  .save("path")
```

This creates a hierarchical structure:

```
address=India/
  gender=Male/
  gender=Female/
```

---

## **Q6. Does the order of partition columns matter?**

**Answer:**
Yes, the order **matters significantly**.

* The first column becomes the **top-level folder**
* The second column becomes a **sub-folder**

The order should be chosen based on **most common filter conditions** used during reads.

---

## **Q7. When does partitioning fail or become inefficient?**

**Answer:**
Partitioning fails when applied to **high-cardinality columns**.

Example:

* Partitioning by `ID` with billions of unique values
* Results in millions or billions of small folders/files
* Causes the **small file problem**
* Degrades performance and metadata handling

---

## **Q8. What is bucketing in Spark?**

**Answer:**
Bucketing divides data into a **fixed number of files (buckets)** using a **hash function** on a column.

Unlike partitioning:

* Bucketing creates **files**, not folders
* Used when data is **high-cardinality or random**

---

## **Q9. When should we use bucketing instead of partitioning?**

**Answer:**
Bucketing should be used when:

* Partitioning is not feasible due to high cardinality
* Columns like **ID or primary key** are used
* Optimized joins and searches are required

---

## **Q10. How do you implement bucketing in Spark?**

**Answer:**
Bucketing is implemented using `bucketBy` along with `saveAsTable`:

```python
df.write
  .bucketBy(5, "id")
  .saveAsTable("employee_bucketed")
```

---

## **Q11. Why is `saveAsTable` mandatory for bucketing?**

**Answer:**
Bucketing metadata (bucket count and column) must be stored in the **Hive Metastore**.

* File-based saves (CSV/Parquet paths) do not store bucket metadata
* Without metadata, Spark cannot apply bucket optimizations

Hence, `saveAsTable` is mandatory.

---

## **Q12. What common mistake leads to too many bucket files?**

**Answer:**
If the DataFrame has many partitions:

* Spark creates **buckets per partition**
* This leads to **partition × bucket files**

Example:

* 200 partitions
* 5 buckets
* Results in **1000 files**

---

## **Q13. How do you ensure the correct number of bucket files?**

**Answer:**
You must **repartition the DataFrame to the same number as buckets** before writing:

```python
df.repartition(5)
  .write
  .bucketBy(5, "id")
  .saveAsTable("employee_bucketed")
```

This ensures exactly **5 bucket files** are created.

---

## **Q14. How does bucketing optimize joins?**

**Answer:**
Bucketing enables **shuffle-free joins** when:

* Both tables are bucketed
* On the same column
* With the same number of buckets

Spark directly joins:

```
Bucket 1 ↔ Bucket 1
Bucket 2 ↔ Bucket 2
```

This avoids expensive network shuffling and significantly improves join performance.

---

## **Q15. How does bucketing improve search performance?**

**Answer:**
Spark applies a **hash function** to the search key.

Example:

* Searching for an ID
* Spark calculates which bucket contains that ID
* Reads only that specific bucket file

Instead of scanning billions of records, Spark scans only a **small subset**, making searches extremely fast.

---

## **Q16. What is bucket pruning?**

**Answer:**
Bucket pruning allows Spark to:

* Identify the exact bucket file
* Read only the required bucket
* Skip scanning unnecessary files

This is similar to partition pruning but works at the **file level**.

---

## **Q17. Can we combine partitioning and bucketing?**

**Answer:**
Yes, Spark allows combining both.

Example:

* Partition by `date`
* Bucket by `id`

This provides:

* Partition pruning for date filters
* Bucket pruning and optimized joins on ID

---

## **Q18. What are the key differences between partitioning and bucketing?**

| Feature      | Partitioning            | Bucketing                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Best for     | Low-cardinality columns | High-cardinality columns            |
| Structure    | Folders (`key=value`)   | Fixed number of files               |
| Optimization | Partition pruning       | Shuffle-free joins, fast search     |
| Metadata     | Stored in path          | Stored in Hive Metastore            |
| Failure case | Too many small folders  | Too many files if not repartitioned |

---

## **Final Interview Tip**

Partitioning and bucketing are **design-time decisions**.
Choosing the wrong strategy can severely impact **performance, storage, and cost**.

How to write dataframe to disk in spark 

---

### **Q1. How do you write a DataFrame to disk in Spark?**

**Answer:**
In Spark, a DataFrame is written to disk using the **DataFrameWriter API**, which is accessed via `df.write`.

The general syntax is:

```python
df.write
  .format("csv")
  .option("header", "true")
  .mode("overwrite")
  .save("path/to/output")
```

This API is used after reading and transforming data, when we want to persist the processed data to storage.

---

### **Q2. What is the general structure of the DataFrameWriter API?**

**Answer:**
The general structure of the DataFrameWriter API is:

1. **`df.write`** – Entry point to the writer API
2. **`.format()`** – Specifies the file format (CSV, Parquet, JSON, etc.)
3. **`.option()`** – Used for format-specific configurations
4. **`.partitionBy()` / `.bucketBy()`** – Used for optimization
5. **`.mode()`** – Defines how to handle existing data
6. **`.save()`** – Triggers the write operation

The `save()` method is an **action** and actually writes the data to disk.

---

### **Q3. What happens if you do not specify a format while writing a DataFrame?**

**Answer:**
If no format is specified, Spark uses **Parquet as the default format**.

Example:

```python
df.write.save("path")
```

This will write the data in **Parquet format**.

---

### **Q4. What are the different save modes available in DataFrameWriter?**

**Answer:**
Spark provides **four save modes** when writing a DataFrame:

1. **Append**
2. **Overwrite**
3. **ErrorIfExists**
4. **Ignore**

These modes define how Spark behaves when data already exists at the target location.

---

### **Q5. Explain Append mode in DataFrameWriter.**

**Answer:**
In **Append mode**:

* If files already exist at the destination path
* Spark **adds new data** to the existing files
* Existing data is **not modified or deleted**

This mode is commonly used in incremental data loads.

---

### **Q6. Explain Overwrite mode in DataFrameWriter.**

**Answer:**
In **Overwrite mode**:

* Spark **deletes all existing files** at the target location
* Writes only the new data

If the DataFrame contains 5 records, only those 5 records will exist after the write operation.

---

### **Q7. What is ErrorIfExists mode?**

**Answer:**
In **ErrorIfExists mode**:

* Spark checks if the output path already exists
* If it exists, Spark throws an error and **stops execution**
* No data is written

This mode is useful when overwriting data is not allowed.

---

### **Q8. What is Ignore mode in DataFrameWriter?**

**Answer:**
In **Ignore mode**:

* If the destination path already exists
* Spark **skips the write operation**
* No error is thrown and no new data is written

This mode is useful when we want to avoid both overwriting and appending data.

---

### **Q9. How does partitioning affect the number of output files?**

**Answer:**
Spark writes **one output file per partition**.

* If the DataFrame has **1 partition**, Spark writes **1 file**
* If the DataFrame has **N partitions**, Spark writes **N files**

Each output file is typically named:

```
part-00000
part-00001
```

---

### **Q10. How can you control the number of output files while writing a DataFrame?**

**Answer:**
The number of output files can be controlled by changing the number of partitions:

* Use **`repartition(n)`** to increase or rebalance partitions
* Use **`coalesce(n)`** to reduce partitions

Example:

```python
df.repartition(3)
  .write
  .format("csv")
  .save("path")
```

This will create **3 output files**.

---

### **Q11. Why does Spark create multiple files instead of a single file?**

**Answer:**
Spark is a **distributed processing engine**.

* Each partition is processed independently
* Each executor writes its own output file
* This design improves **parallelism and performance**

Writing a single file would reduce parallelism and cause a bottleneck.

---

### **Q12. How can you verify the output files after writing a DataFrame?**

**Answer:**
In Databricks, output files can be verified using:

```python
dbutils.fs.ls("path")
```

This command lists all files written to the destination directory.

---

### **Q13. Is writing a DataFrame to disk a transformation or an action?**

**Answer:**
Writing a DataFrame is an **action**.

* Spark executes all lazy transformations
* Data is finally written to disk only when `save()` is called

---

### **Q14. What are common interview topics related to DataFrame writing?**

**Answer:**
Common interview questions include:

* Save modes in DataFrameWriter
* Difference between `partitionBy` and `bucketBy`
* Impact of partitions on output files
* Default file format in Spark
* Difference between `repartition` and `coalesce`

---

### **Final Interview Tip**

Understanding **how Spark writes data**, **save modes**, and **partition behavior** is very important because these concepts directly impact **performance, storage layout, and data correctness** in production systems.

If you want, I can next prepare:

* **PartitionBy vs BucketBy (deep interview explanation)**
* **Repartition vs Coalesce comparison**
* **Spark file formats interview Q&A**

Just tell me 👍

RDD
---

### **Q1. What is an RDD in Apache Spark?**

**Answer:**
RDD stands for **Resilient Distributed Dataset**.
It is the **core data abstraction** of Apache Spark.

An RDD is:

* A **distributed collection of data**
* Stored across multiple nodes in a **cluster**
* Processed **in parallel in memory**

Internally, **all Spark operations are ultimately executed on RDDs**, even when we use DataFrames or Datasets.

---

### **Q2. Why is RDD called “Resilient”?**

**Answer:**
RDD is called **Resilient** because it is **fault tolerant**.

If a partition of an RDD is lost due to node or executor failure:

* Spark uses **lineage information**
* Lineage tells Spark how the RDD was created
* Spark **recomputes the lost partitions automatically**

This self-recovery mechanism makes RDD resilient.

---

### **Q3. Why is RDD called “Distributed”?**

**Answer:**
RDD is distributed because its data is **spread across multiple machines** in a cluster.

Example:

* If we have 500 MB of data
* And the block size is 128 MB
* The data will be split into **4 partitions**
* Each partition is processed by a different executor

This distribution enables **parallel processing** and improves performance.

---

### **Q4. What does “Dataset” mean in RDD?**

**Answer:**
Dataset refers to the **actual data** being processed.

An RDD is not just metadata; it contains:

* Real data
* Which is processed using transformations and actions

---

### **Q5. Are RDDs mutable or immutable? Explain.**

**Answer:**
RDDs are **immutable**.

Once an RDD is created, it **cannot be modified**.
Any transformation applied to an RDD creates a **new RDD**.

Example:

* Applying a `filter` creates RDD1
* Applying another filter on RDD1 creates RDD2
* Original RDD remains unchanged

Immutability helps Spark achieve fault tolerance and consistency.

---

### **Q6. What is Lazy Evaluation in RDD?**

**Answer:**
RDD transformations are **lazily evaluated**.

This means:

* Transformations are not executed immediately
* Spark waits until an **action** (like `count`, `collect`, or `show`) is called

Before execution:

* Spark builds a **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**
* This DAG represents the **lineage** of transformations

Execution starts only when an action is triggered.

---

### **Q7. How does RDD provide fault tolerance?**

**Answer:**
RDD provides fault tolerance using **lineage information**.

If an RDD or its partition fails:

* Spark traces back the lineage
* Identifies the transformations used to create the RDD
* Recomputes the missing data automatically

This avoids the need for data replication.

---

### **Q8. What are the disadvantages of using RDD?**

**Answer:**

1. **No Automatic Optimization**

   * Spark does not optimize RDD operations automatically
   * The developer must manage performance manually

2. **“How to” Instead of “What to”**

   * RDD requires developers to specify *how* to process data
   * DataFrames allow specifying *what* result is required

3. **Complex Code**

   * Operations like `groupBy` and `join` are verbose and complex in RDD
   * Much simpler in DataFrames or SQL

4. **Performance Limitations**

   * Spark cannot reorder or optimize RDD operations
   * Execution follows the developer-defined order

---

### **Q9. Explain the performance difference between RDD and DataFrame.**

**Answer:**

Example:
Operations — `reduceByKey` followed by `filter`

* **RDD**

  * Spark first performs a full shuffle
  * Then applies the filter
  * This is computationally expensive

* **DataFrame**

  * Spark applies the filter first
  * Reduces the dataset size
  * Then performs shuffle
  * This improves performance

Reason: **Catalyst Optimizer**, which works only with DataFrames/Datasets.

---

### **Q10. Why should we avoid using RDD in most cases?**

**Answer:**
RDDs should generally be avoided because:

* They lack automatic optimization
* Code is more complex
* Performance is usually lower compared to DataFrames

Modern Spark applications prefer **DataFrames and Datasets**.

---

### **Q11. When should we use RDD?**

**Answer:**
RDDs are useful when:

1. **Processing Unstructured Data**

   * Text files
   * Logs
   * Raw data without schema

2. **Type Safety is Required**

   * RDD provides compile-time type checking
   * DataFrames detect type errors at runtime

3. **Full Low-Level Control is Needed**

   * Custom transformations
   * Fine-grained performance tuning

---

### **Q12. Are RDDs type-safe?**

**Answer:**
Yes, RDDs are **type-safe**.

Type mismatches are detected at **compile time**, reducing runtime failures.

---

### **Q13. What is the relationship between RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset?**

**Answer:**

* DataFrames and Datasets are built **on top of RDDs**
* Internally, Spark converts them into RDDs during execution
* Understanding RDDs helps in understanding Spark internals

---

### **Q14. What is the current industry preference: RDD or DataFrame?**

**Answer:**
The industry strongly prefers:

* **DataFrames**
* **Datasets**

Because they are:

* Optimized
* Easier to use
* Suitable for both engineers and analysts

---

### **Final Interview Tip**

Even though RDDs are used less in real projects today,
**interviewers expect strong knowledge of RDDs** because they form the **foundation of Apache Spark**.

driver out of memory spark
**Driver Memory Management** and how to handle **Out of Memory (OOM)** exceptions, which is a very common topic for queries and interviews.

### 2. The Experiment: Creating the Error First
Before discussing solutions, the YouTuber believes in creating the problem first so you can relate to it.
*   **The Setup:** He uses a local `pyspark` setup.
*   **The Command:** He initializes a Spark session specifically requesting a small driver memory to force the error: `--driver-memory 1gb`.
*   **The Test:**
    1.  He creates a DataFrame with a very large range of numbers.
    2.  **Action 1 (`df.show()`):** When he runs this, it executes successfully without any error.
    3.  **Action 2 (`df.collect()`):** When he runs this on the same data, the application crashes.
*   **The Result:** The error log displays `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`.

### 3. Understanding the Architecture
To explain why `collect()` failed while `show()` passed, we look at the internal architecture:
*   The Driver runs inside an **Application Master container** on a worker node.
*   Inside the Driver, memory is divided into two main configurations:
    1.  **Driver Memory (JVM Heap):** Configured via `spark.driver.memory`. This handles JVM processes, task scheduling, and the results.
    2.  **Memory Overhead:** Configured via `spark.driver.memoryOverhead`. This handles non-JVM processes, objects, and container requirements.

### 4. The "Why": `show()` vs. `collect()`
The YouTuber explains the technical reason for the crash observed in the experiment:
*   **Why `collect()` Crashes:** When you run `collect()`, the Driver tries to fetch **all partitions** from all executors and load them into the Driver's JVM Heap.
    *   *The Math:* If you have three partitions of 500MB each (Total 1.5GB) and you try to squeeze them into a Driver that only has **1GB** of space, it is physically impossible. This causes the OOM error.
*   **Why `show()` Works:** This method does not need to see the whole dataset. It only fetches enough data (e.g., one partition) to display the requested rows (like 20 rows). Since one partition fits easily into the memory, it does not crash.

### 5. Deep Dive: Memory Overhead and Containers
The concept of the **Container** is explained using a phone analogy: just as a phone has a hard limit (e.g., 256GB) and cannot store more, a Container has a fixed memory limit.

**The Calculation Rule for Overhead:**
The Memory Overhead is vital for non-JVM processes. The size is calculated as **10% of the Driver Memory**, but there is a catch—it must be a **minimum of 384 MB**.
*   *Scenario A (Large Driver):* If you have 4GB Driver Memory, 10% is 400MB. Since 400MB > 384MB, the overhead is **400MB**.
*   *Scenario B (Small Driver):* In the demo (1GB Driver), 10% is only 100MB. Since this is less than the minimum, Spark automatically allocates **384MB**.

### 6. Common Reasons for Driver OOM & Solutions (Interview Questions)
The video summarises the three main reasons why a Driver goes Out of Memory and how to answer this in an interview:

**1. Using the `collect()` Method**
*   **Reason:** As shown in the demo, this brings all data to the Driver, overwhelming the heap.
*   **Solution:** Avoid using `collect()` on large datasets.

**2. Broadcast Joins**
*   **Reason:** In a Broadcast join, the Driver must fetch the smaller dataframes (e.g., `df2` and `df3`) to perform a union and then "broadcast" (send) them to all executors.
*   **The Issue:** If you have multiple tables or have increased the broadcast threshold (e.g., to 50MB), the total data (e.g., 5 tables x 50MB = 250MB) must sit in the Driver memory first. If the Driver is already busy or the data exceeds available space, it crashes.
*   **Solution:** Ensure the Driver has enough memory to hold the tables intended for broadcasting.

**3. Excessive Objects / Overhead Issues**
*   **Reason:** If the application creates too many objects or runs heavy non-JVM processes, it fills up the Memory Overhead. It can also happen if you manually set the `spark.driver.memoryOverhead` configuration too low (lower than the default requirement).
*   **Solution:** Increase the `spark.driver.memoryOverhead` configuration if the error logs indicate an overhead issue.

executor out of memory spark | spark memory management 

### **Potential Interview Questions**
The YouTuber highlights several "famous" questions addressed in the video:
*   **Why do we get OOM** even when data can be spilled to disk?
*   How does Spark manage **internal storage**?
*   How are **tasks split** inside an executor?
*   What is the use of **Overhead Memory** (usually 10%)?
*   What are the different **Memory Managers** in Spark?

### **Executor Architecture & Container Size**
When you request a 10GB executor, Spark doesn't just give you 10GB; it creates a container that includes **Overhead Memory**.

*   **Configuration:** `spark.executor.memory` (e.g., 10GB) + `spark.executor.memoryOverhead` (10% of executor memory, min 384MB).
*   **Total Container Size:** In the example of a 10GB executor, the total size becomes **11GB** (10GB + 1GB overhead).
*   **Physical Limit:** You cannot exceed this 11GB limit. If the process crosses this physical memory limit, you will get an **OOM exception**.

### **Memory Division: JVM vs. Non-JVM**
The 11GB container is split into two main parts:
1.  **Non-JVM Process (Overhead Memory - 1GB):** Used for **PySpark applications**, container management (takes ~300-400MB), and other non-JVM objects.
2.  **JVM Process (Executor Memory - 10GB):** This is where the actual Spark engine runs.

### **Internal JVM Memory Breakdown**
The 10GB JVM memory is further divided into three layers:
*   **Reserved Memory:** Fixed at **300MB**. It stores Spark's internal objects. **Rule:** Your executor size must be at least 1.5 times the reserved memory (approx. 450MB+), or Spark will throw an error.
*   **User Memory (40% of remaining):** Approximately **3.8GB**. It stores **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**, user-defined data structures, RDD operations, and Spark internal metadata.
*   **Spark Memory (60% of remaining):** Approximately **5.8GB**. This is used for **Dataframe operations**.

### **Spark Memory: Storage vs. Execution**
The Spark Memory pool (5.8GB) is split 50/50 into two pools:
1.  **Storage Memory Pool (2.9GB):** Used for caching data (`df.persist`, `df.cache`) and intermediate results. It uses an **LRU (Least Recently Used)** mechanism to evict old cache if space is needed.
2.  **Execution Memory Pool (2.9GB):** Short-lived memory used for transformations, shuffles, joins, and **Hash Tables**.

### **Memory Managers**
*   **Static Memory Manager:** (Used in older versions < 1.6.0) It had hard boundaries between storage and execution.
*   **Unified Memory Manager:** (Used in versions 1.6.0+) It allows for **flexible boundaries**. If the Execution pool needs more memory and Storage is empty, Execution can "borrow" memory from the Storage pool.

### **The Big Question: Why OOM if Spilling exists?**
Even though Spark can spill to disk, OOM occurs primarily due to **Data Skew**:
*   **The Join Scenario:** Imagine joining `df1` and `df2` on an ID. If you have a **skewed key** (e.g., ID "1" has 3GB of data) but your Execution pool only has 2.9GB of physical space, Spark **must** bring all records of that same key to the same executor to perform the join.
*   **The Failure:** Because that specific ID's data (3GB) exceeds the available physical memory (2.9GB), Spark cannot process it. You can't just spill "half" a key's join logic and get an accurate result.
*   **Solution:** You need to use techniques like **Salting** or **Re-partitioning**.

### **Task Splitting and Cores**
The number of parallel tasks an executor runs depends on the **Cores**:
*   If an executor has **4 cores**, it can run **4 tasks in parallel**.
*   **Recommendation:** It is generally recommended to use **3 to 5 cores per executor**.
*   **Risk:** If you use too many cores (>5), the overhead of managing many partitions and objects can lead to **Memory Overhead errors**.

spark submit
Spark Submit is a command-line tool used to run Spark applications. It works by taking all necessary files and JARs, packaging them, and triggering the application on the cluster. 
The cluster can be located in several places: Standalone, Local mode, Kubernetes, or YARN (which is the most common

Dynamic Allocation: Setting spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true allows Spark to release resources that are idle so other processes can use them.
• Executor Limits: You can set minExecutors (e.g., 1) and maxExecutors (e.g., 10) to prevent a single job from consuming all cluster memory.
• Broadcast Settings: You can adjust autoBroadcastJoinThreshold and broadcastTimeout. While he mentions a 3600-second (1-hour) timeout for extreme cases, he typically recommends starting

dynamic resource allocation in spark 

### 1. Introduction & Interview Questions
Sabse pehle unhone bataya ki interview mein is topic se kya questions aate hain:
*   Dynamic Resource Allocation kya hota hai?
*   Resource Manager resources kaise allocate karta hai?
*   Kaun-kaun si techniques hain (Static vs Dynamic)?
*   Challenges kya hain aur process fail kyun ho sakta hai?
*   Dynamic Allocation kab avoid karna chahiye?
*   Configurations kaun si lagti hain?

### 2. The Scenario (Problem Statement with Example)
Unhone ek real-world example se samjhaya ki Dynamic Allocation ki zarurat kyun padi:

*   **User 1 (Heavy Job):** Ek developer ne `spark-submit` command chalayi. Usne configuration rakhi:
    *   **Executors:** 49 (Max executors).
    *   **Executor Memory:** 20 GB.
    *   **Cores:** 4 per executor.
    *   **Driver Memory:** 20 GB.
    *   **Calculation:** $49 \times 20$ GB = 980 GB + 20 GB Driver = **Total 1000 GB** use kar liya.
*   **Cluster Condition:** Maan lijiye poore cluster ki capacity hi 1000 GB RAM aur 196 Cores thi. Iska matlab User 1 ne poora cluster full kar diya.
*   **User 2 (Small Job):** Ab ek dusra developer aata hai jise sirf **25 GB** chahiye (20 GB executor + 5 GB driver).
*   **Problem:** Resource Manager (RM) **FIFO (First In First Out)** pe kaam karta hai. Kyunki cluster full hai, RM bolega "Wait karo". User 2 ka job ho sakta hai 5 minute ka ho, lekin use User 1 ke 5 ghante ke job ke khatam hone ka wait karna padega.

Development environment mein ye aksar hota hai ki log resource lekar baith jate hain par kaam nahi kar rahe hote, jisse baaki log block ho jate hain.

### 3. Static vs. Dynamic Resource Allocation
Yahan do techniques aati hain:
*   **Static Resource Allocation:** Ek baar jo memory mil gayi (e.g., 100 GB), wo poore time (pure application duration tak) reserve rehti hai, chahe aap use karein ya na karein.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Agar aapka process resource use nahi kar raha, to use release (khali) kar diya jata hai taaki dusre use kar sakein.

### 4. How Dynamic Allocation Works (Release & Acquire)
Is process ko enable karne ke liye `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled = true` set karna padta hai (by default ye false hota hai).

*   **Releasing Resources:**
    *   Maan lo shuru mein load karte waqt 1000 GB chahiye tha.
    *   Phir filter lagaya, data kam ho gaya, ab sirf 500 GB ki zarurat hai.
    *   Dynamic allocation mein bacha hua **500 GB release** kar diya jayega.
    *   Phir aur data kam hua, to aur 250 GB release ho jayega.

*   **Acquiring Resources (On Demand):**
    *   Agar aage chalkar koi Join operation aata hai aur wapas memory ki zarurat padti hai, to Spark Resource Manager se demand karega.
    *   **Risk/Challenge:** Resource Manager kisi se jabardasti resource khali nahi karwa sakta. Agar wo release kiya hua 500 GB kisi aur process ne le liya hai, to aapke process ko wapas resource nahi milega aur **process fail ho sakta hai**.

### 5. Solutions & Configurations (Detailed)
Process fail hone se bachane ke liye kuch configurations set ki jati hain:

*   **Min & Max Executors:**
    *   `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`: Default 1 hota hai, par hume isse badhana chahiye (jaise ki example mein **5 ya 20** set kar sakte hain). Iska matlab hai ki chahe kaam ho ya na ho, itne executors hamesha aapke paas rahenge taaki process starve na ho.
    *   `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`: Maximum kitne executors hum le sakte hain (example mein **49** tha).

*   **External Shuffle Service / Shuffle Tracking:**
    *   **Challenge:** Jab executor khali (kill) kiya jata hai, to uske disk pe rakha hua **Shuffle Data (Map output/exchange data)** bhi chala jata hai. Agar ye data chala gaya, to Join ke time recalculate karna padega.
    *   **Solution:** `spark.shuffle.service.enabled` (ya shuffle tracking) ko true karte hain. Ye service `Worker Node` pe alag se chalti hai aur data ko hold karti hai, bhale hi executor kill ho jaye. Isse recalculation nahi karni padti.

### 6. Timing & Request Strategy (Bahut Important Detail)
Video mein ye bhi explain kiya gaya hai ki resource kab chhoda jata hai aur kab maanga jata hai:

*   **Kab Release karega (Idle Timeout):** Agar koi executor **60 seconds** (default) tak idle hai (koi kaam nahi kar raha), to usko release kar diya jayega. Aap is config ko change bhi kar sakte hain (jaise video mein 45 sec kiya tha).
*   **Kab Request karega (Backlog Timeout):** Agar pending tasks ko resource nahi mil raha aur wo **1 second** se zyada wait kar rahe hain, to new executors ki demand shuru hogi.
*   **Kaise Maangega (Two-Fold Strategy):**
    *   Aisa nahi hai ki seedha 500 GB maang lega.
    *   Ye **exponentially (Two-Fold)** maangta hai: Pehle **1** executor maangega, agar kaam nahi bana to **2** maangega, phir **4**, phir **8**, phir **16**... is tarah se badhta jayega.

### 7. When to Avoid Dynamic Allocation?
Interview mein ye pucha jata hai.
*   **Production Critical Jobs:** Agar aap production mein koi critical job chala rahe hain jahan aap SLA (Time) miss nahi kar sakte, wahan Dynamic Allocation **avoid** karna chahiye.
*   Wahan **Static Allocation** use karein taaki resources guaranteed rahein aur resource na milne ki wajah se job fail ya delay na ho.

### 8. Summary of Configurations Mentioned
Video mein dikhaye gaye `spark-submit` mein ye settings thin:
*   `spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled`: true
*   `spark.shuffle.service.enabled`: true (ya shuffle tracking)
*   `spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors`: (e.g., 5)
*   `spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`: (e.g., 49)
*   `spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout`: (e.g., 60s)

cache vs persist
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw1vn82wEBE&list=PLTsNSGeIpGnFiErPovNizG_2IP2RvrgnK&index=45
Chaliye, main aapko bilkul usi flow aur tone mein samjhata hoon jaise video mein explain kiya gaya hai using HinEnglish.

### 1. Basic Concept aur Memory Management Recap
Sabse pehle, Caching kya hai? Ye ek optimization technique hai jo hamare **intermediate results** ko store karke rakhta hai.

Isko samajhne ke liye humne Spark Memory Management (Executor wala part) ko recap kiya tha. Executor ke container ke andar teen cheezein hoti hain: User Memory, Spark Memory, aur Reserved Memory. Spark Memory ke andar do pools hote hain:
1.  **Storage Memory Pool**
2.  **Executor Memory Pool**

Jab bhi hum data ko cache karte hain, toh wo data sirf aur sirf **Storage Memory Pool** mein jaake store hota hai. Agar Execution pool (jahan calculation hoti hai) ko memory ki zaroorat padti hai, toh wo Storage pool se data ko "evict" (udha) kar sakta hai LRU (Least Recently Used) fashion mein.

### 2. Example: Caching ki zaroorat kyun hai? (The "Why")
Ab main aapko code example se samjhata hoon ki humein iski actual need kyun padti hai.

Imagine kijiye humne ek code likha:
*   Pehle `df` banaya ek file load karke.
*   Phir `df2` banaya jisme `df` ko join kiya `df1` ke saath.
*   Phir `df4` banaya jisme usi `df` ko join kiya `df3` ke saath.

Spark mein DataFrames immutable hote hain aur operations **Lazily Evaluated** hote hain. `df` jo hai wo Executor ki "short-lived memory" mein banta hai.
*   Jab `df2` ke liye action call hoga, `df` calculate hoga aur use ho jayega.
*   Lekin jab `df4` banega, toh kyunki `df` memory se chala gaya tha (short-lived tha), Spark wapas jayega aur DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) ke through `df` ko **re-calculate** karega.

Isse hamara time waste hoga. Isiliye hum `df.cache()` use karte hain. Jaise hi hum `.cache()` likhte hain, data short-lived memory se uth kar **Storage Memory Pool** mein aa jata hai jo long-term ke liye rehta hai (jab tak application chal rahi hai). Isse baar-baar re-calculation nahi karni padti.

### 3. Partition aur Storage Logic
Yahan ek bahut important interview question banta hai. Maan lijiye aapke paas 2GB ka storage pool hai lekin data 2.5GB ka hai.
*   Spark kabhi bhi **half partition** store nahi karega. Agar wo 12 partitions store kar pa raha hai aur 13th partition aadha fit ho raha hai, toh wo us aadhe ko store nahi karega.
*   Jo partitions fit nahi honge, unhein ya toh disk pe bheja jayega (agar level waisa hai) ya phir unhein **re-calculate** kiya jayega.
*   Agar koi partition galti se **lost** ho jata hai, toh DAG usse wapas re-calculate kar leta hai.

### 4. Cache vs Persist
Bahut baar pucha jata hai: **Difference between Cache and Persist?**
Seedha sa answer hai: `Persist` hi main function hai. `Cache` bas `Persist` ke upar likha gaya ek wrapper hai.
*   **Cache:** Jab hum `.cache()` call karte hain, toh wo internal `.persist()` ko call karta hai ek fixed default storage level ke saath (Video mein bataya gaya hai ki default `MEMORY_AND_DISK` set hota hai).
*   **Persist:** `.persist()` humein flexibility deta hai ki hum arguments pass kar sakein, yaani hum apna **Storage Level** khud choose kar sakte hain.

### 5. Storage Levels (In-Depth)
Humne alag-alag storage levels discuss kiye jo aap `.persist()` mein use kar sakte hain:

*   **MEMORY_ONLY:**
    *   Ye data ko sirf RAM mein rakhta hai **Deserialized** form mein.
    *   **Advantage:** Process fast hota hai.
    *   **Disadvantage:** Memory utilization bahut high hoti hai.
*   **MEMORY_AND_DISK:**
    *   Pehle RAM mein try karega. Agar RAM full ho gayi, toh bacha hua data **Disk** pe bhej dega.
    *   Disk pe data hamesha **Serialized** form mein rehta hai.
    *   Disk se read/write karne mein time lagta hai aur CPU usage high ho sakta hai kyunki data ko wapas deserialize karna padega.
*   **DISK_ONLY:**
    *   Sara data disk pe rahega. Ye slow hota hai.
*   **_SER (Serialized) levels (e.g., MEMORY_ONLY_SER):**
    *   Data ko byte stream (Serialized) mein rakhta hai.
    *   **Benefit:** Space bachta hai (e.g., 5GB data compress hoke kam jagah lega).
    *   **Drawback:** Jab use karna hoga toh CPU usage high hoga kyunki De-serialization karna padega.
    *   *Note:* Video ke end mein bataya tha ki ye Serialization wala feature mainly **Java aur Scala** mein kaam karta hai, Python mein directly aise nahi dikhta.
*   **_2 (Replication) levels (e.g., MEMORY_ONLY_2):**
    *   Ye data ki 2 copies rakhta hai alag-alag nodes pe.
    *   Agar ek worker node down ho gaya, toh doosre node se data le lega taaki re-calculation na karna pade.

### 6. Practical Demo aur "Show" vs "Count" ka catch
Humne code run karke bhi dekha Spark UI pe.
*   Jab humne `df.cache()` ke baad sirf `df.show()` kiya: Spark UI ke Storage tab mein sirf **1 Partition** cache hua dikha. Kyunki Spark intelligent hai, usne dekha ki `show()` ke liye sirf top rows chahiye, toh poora data kyu cache karein?.
*   Jab humne `df.count()` kiya: Tab saare partitions (4 partitions) cache huye kyunki count ke liye poora data chahiye tha.
*   UI mein humne dekha ki **Serialized (Disk)** data ka size (1.2 MB) kam tha as compared to **Deserialized (Memory)** data (3.3 MB).

### 7. Unpersist aur Conclusion
Last mein, agar data ko memory se hatana hai toh kya karein?
Simple, `df.unpersist()` method call kar dijiye, data cache se hatt jayega.

Toh ye thi saari kahani Cache aur Persist ki. Maine koshish ki hai ki koi bhi detail miss na ho. Agar aap ye saare points (Intermediate results, Lazy evaluation example, Partition logic, Storage levels difference) interview mein bol denge, toh I don't think koi aapko phasa payega.

**Link:** Description mein documentation ka link mil jayega, wahan se aur detail padh lena.

Chaliye, milte hain agle video mein. Tab tak ke liye, Bye Bye!

Delta Tables Liquid Clustering and Deletion Vectors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EveYBUZP__4&t=115s
Before we start, it is very important that you understand partitioning and Z-ordering techniques, as Liquid Clustering helps improve performance where you have data with high cardinality. So without any delay, let’s begin.

### Deletion Vectors

What exactly are Deletion Vectors? In a normal data scenario, whenever we modify data in a particular Parquet file—even if you just try to delete one record out of millions—the whole Parquet file will get rewritten. That is an optimization issue.

The solution is to add Deletion Vectors. If the table is enabled with this feature, when you delete a single row, a vector or a "flag" is added to that row. The data will not be rewritten; rather, the row in the Parquet file is flagged as deleted. Next time when you read the data, only the rows not marked or flagged will be read. Later, when you run your maintenance—which is the `OPTIMIZE` command—the Parquet file gets rewritten and all the rows marked for deletion are removed.

**Let's go ahead and see this in action:**

1.  **Setup:** We use the `read_files` utility to read a CSV file and create a table (`dev.bronze.sales`).
2.  **Checking Properties:** If we run `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` on the table, we can see the property `enable deletion vectors` is set to true by default.
3.  **The Test (Disabled):**
    *   First, we turn off the vector by running `ALTER TABLE ... SET TBLPROPERTIES ... false`.
    *   We delete a specific invoice number. When we check `DESCRIBE HISTORY`, we see that Delta has removed files and added new files. This means the data was rewritten.
4.  **The Test (Enabled):**
    *   *Note:* To use this, you need Delta Lake 2.3.0+ or Databricks Runtime 12.2 LTS+.
    *   We set the property back to `true`.
    *   We delete another invoice number. Now, if we look at `DESCRIBE HISTORY`, we see "deletion vectors added" and the number of files added is zero. The data is not rewritten; it just added flags.
    *   You can then run the `OPTIMIZE` command to automatically remove those flagged records while rewriting the file.

### Liquid Clustering

Now, let's check what is **Liquid Clustering**. In previous videos, we saw Z-ordering or partitioning, but in those cases, we have to rewrite the data whenever we try to optimize the table.

But there is one "neat way" Delta table has introduced called Liquid Clustering. Whenever you enable clustering, you don't need to rewrite the data; the incremental data will automatically get adjusted as per the cluster column you mentioned.

**When should you use this?**
You can use it if you have a high cardinality column to filter on, significant skew in your data, data growing too quickly, or different access patterns. To use this, you need Delta Lake 3.1.0+ or Databricks Runtime 13.3 LTS+.

**How do we do it?**
We just need to use `CLUSTER BY`.

*   **On an existing table:** You run `ALTER TABLE table_name CLUSTER BY column_name` (e.g., invoice number). If you want to go back to a simple table without clustering, you just use `CLUSTER BY NONE`.
*   **On a new table:** While creating the table, you mention `CLUSTER BY` and the column name.

**Important Limitation:**
You can have more than one clustering column, but you need to have the column within the first **32 columns** in the Delta table.

Once you do this, running a `SELECT *` with a filter on that column runs so fast, and the new incremental data will automatically get clustered properly so you don't have to worry about maintenance.

I hope you have learned a lot about Delta tables. In our next video, we are going to talk about **Volumes**, and we will see Delta Sharing towards the end of our series.

Till then, keep learning, keep growing, and keep sharing.

Data Skipping and Z-Ordering in Delta Lake Tables
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMAmZQIMfA&t=604s
### Introduction to Data Skipping and Z-Ordering
In our last discussion, we saw the importance of avoiding unnecessary data scans using partitioning. Today, we will understand **data skipping** and the importance of **Z-Ordering**. Data skipping and avoiding unnecessary scanning are almost the same thing.

### The Problem: High Cardinality Columns
Consider an example where we have orders data with order numbers like `o001`. If we search based on "Country," we can partition the data by country. However, what if we have to search only by `order_id`? We know `order_id` is a **high cardinality column**. We cannot partition by `order_id` because it would create too many partitions, causing the query to lag.

Since we cannot implement partitioning on the order ID column, normally we would have to scan all the files to find a specific order. To prevent this, Delta Lake implements Z-Ordering.

### How Z-Ordering Works
To optimize this, you run a query specifying to **Z-Order by `order_id`**. Here is what happens in the background:
1.  All the data for that column is sorted.
2.  It is distributed sequentially into different files (e.g., File 1 has orders 101–104, File 2 has 105–108).
3.  Delta Lake stores this information in its metadata.

When you search for a specific order (e.g., 106), Delta Lake checks the metadata. It knows the second file contains the range 105 to 108, so it will **skip** the first and third files and only scan the second file.

Z-Ordering is also **multi-dimensional**, meaning you can implement it on more than one column (e.g., Country and Order ID). In this case, the Country data is sorted first, and then the Order ID is sorted within that.

### The Live Example (Retail Data)
Let's see this in action using Databricks Community Edition with retail sales data containing columns like `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, and `Country`.

1.  **The Setup:** We have written this data as a Delta table with 16 files. The data is unevenly distributed, and the invoice numbers overlap across different files.
2.  **The Issue:** When we run a query to select a specific `InvoiceNo`, the Spark UI shows that the **number of files read is 16**. This is because Delta Lake doesn't know where the invoice lies, so it scans everything.
3.  **Configuration:** Before optimizing, we change the `spark.databricks.delta.optimize.maxFileSize` configuration. The default is 1 GB. Since our data is small, we set it to **64 MB** to ensure we create enough files to demonstrate Z-Ordering effectively.

### Implementing the Optimization
We run the following command:
`OPTIMIZE SalesDelta ZORDER BY invoice_number`.

**What happens:**
*   Delta arranges all invoice numbers in sequence and distributes them into different Parquet files.
*   When we check the minimum and maximum invoice numbers per file, they are no longer overlapping. They are perfectly sequential.

**The Result:**
When we run the search query for the invoice number again:
*   It finishes in **0.5 seconds** (compared to 3 seconds previously).
*   The **number of files read is 1** (compared to 16 previously).
*   The metrics show that 16 files were removed and 16 new, sorted files were added.

### Multi-Dimensional Z-Ordering Warning
We then try optimizing by **Country** and **Invoice Number** together.
*   If we search *without* the country filter, the number of files read increases (e.g., to 2) because the data is distributed differently.
*   If we add `Country = 'Australia'` to the filter, it goes back to reading just 1 file.

It is very important that you select your Z-Orders properly. You cannot blindly put any column as a Z-Order; it might create problems.

### The Best Approach: Combining Partitioning and Z-Ordering
Is there a better way? Yes. We can **partition** the table based on Country and then **Z-Order** the data based on Invoice Number.

1.  We take a table partitioned by Country (e.g., a folder for Australia containing 16 files).
2.  We perform a **selective optimization**:
    `OPTIMIZE SalesDelta WHERE Country = 'Australia' ZORDER BY invoice_number`.

**The Outcome:**
When we search for an invoice in Australia:
*   **Number of partitions read:** 1.
*   **Number of files read:** 1.
This is **data skipping at its best**.

### Auto Compaction
Finally, note that Delta tables provide **Auto Compaction**. This means small files can be automatically compacted into larger ones. However, the data will **not** be Z-Ordered automatically. Z-Ordering is an instruction you must specifically provide.

CDC
### 1. What is Change Data Capture (CDC)?
The YouTuber introduces CDC not as a tool-specific feature, but as a fundamental concept in data engineering and ETL pipelines. Put simply, CDC is the process of understanding how data changes over time. If you ingest data from a source system on "Day 1" and then again on "Day 2", specific records may have changed—names might be updated, or addresses altered. Capturing these variations is essential for building data lakes or data stores.

### 2. The Three Types of Data Changes
There are three primary ways data changes in a source system:
*   **Insertion:** A completely new record is added.
*   **Update:** An existing field within a record is modified (e.g., an address changes from "Pune" to "Bangalore").
*   **Deletion:** A record is removed from the source system.

**Example:**
On Day 1, you have records with IDs 1, 2, and 3. On Day 2:
*   ID 1’s address changes (Update).
*   ID 2 disappears (Delete).
*   ID 4 appears (Insert).

### 3. Handling Load Scenarios
The video explains three specific scenarios for handling these changes, depending on how the source sends data:

#### **Scenario A: Full Load**
This is the simplest scenario. Every day, the source system sends the **entire dataset** again, regardless of what changed.
*   **How to handle it:** You simply overwrite the data from the previous day with the new dataset. Because you receive a fresh copy of everything, updates, inserts, and deletes are automatically reflected by the new file.

#### **Scenario B: Incremental Load (With Flags)**
The source sends only the data that changed and provides a flag indicating the type of change (e.g., 'I' for Insert, 'U' for Update, 'D' for Delete).
*   **Inserts (Flag 'I'):** Simply append these new records to your table.
*   **Updates (Flag 'U'):** You must locate the existing records (often by partitioning) and update them.
*   **Deletes (Flag 'D'):** You locate and remove or flag these records.

#### **Scenario C: Incremental Load (Without Flags)**
This is more complex. The source sends changed data but does **not** tell you if it is an insert or an update.
*   **How to handle it:** You must perform a **Left Outer Join** between the incoming dataset and your existing table.
*   **Logic:** Match records using the Primary Key.
    *   If there is **no match**, it is a new record (Insert).
    *   If there is a **match**, compare the columns of interest. If the data differs, it is an Update.
*   **Important Note:** To avoid performance issues with very wide tables, discuss with the business side which specific columns need to be tracked for changes, rather than checking every single column.
*   **Limitation:** You cannot identify deleted records in this scenario because the source does not explicitly tell you what is missing.

### 4. Storage Strategies: SCD Types
Once changes are identified, the YouTuber explains how to store them using Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD).

#### **SCD Type 1 (Latest Version Only)**
*   **Concept:** You only keep the most current version of the data. History is not preserved.
*   **Example:** If a customer moves from Pune to Bangalore, the system overwrites "Pune" with "Bangalore." You will have no record that they ever lived in Pune.

#### **SCD Type 2 (Full History)**
*   **Concept:** You keep the entire history of changes. If a record is updated, the old version is kept, and a new version is inserted as a new row.
*   **Implementation:** You add columns such as **Start Date**, **End Date**, and a **Flag** (e.g., `is_latest` or `is_active`).
*   **Example:**
    *   **Row 1:** ID 1, Address: Pune, Start: 1st July, End: 2nd July, Active: N.
    *   **Row 2:** ID 1, Address: Bangalore, Start: 2nd July, End: NULL, Active: Y.
*   **Benefit:** To see the current state of the world, you simply filter the table where the "Active" flag is set to 'Y' or the End Date is NULL.

### 5. Handling Deletes
Finally, the video explains two ways to handle deleted records when they are identified:
*   **Soft Delete:** You do not physically remove the record. Instead, you update a flag column (e.g., `Delete_Flag`) to 'Y'. This keeps the data for historical reference.
*   **Hard Delete:** You physically remove the record from your storage. This is less common in data warehousing unless specifically required.

-- CDC SCENARIO C: INCREMENTAL LOAD WITHOUT FLAGS (SQL IMPLEMENTATION)
-- ============================================================================

-- Step 1: Create sample tables
-- ============================================================================

-- Existing table (your current data lake/warehouse table)
CREATE TABLE existing_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert sample existing data
INSERT INTO existing_table (id, name, address, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'Pune', 50000),
(2, 'Bob', 'Mumbai', 60000),
(3, 'Charlie', 'Delhi', 55000);

-- Staging table (incoming data from source)
CREATE TABLE staging_table (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Insert incoming data (Day 2)
INSERT INTO staging_table (id, name, address, salary) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 'Bangalore', 50000),  -- Address changed (UPDATE)
(3, 'Charlie', 'Delhi', 65000),    -- Salary changed (UPDATE)
(4, 'Diana', 'Kolkata', 58000);    -- New record (INSERT)


-- Step 2: Identify INSERTS (records in staging but not in existing)
-- ============================================================================

SELECT 
    s.*,
    'INSERT' AS change_type
FROM staging_table s
LEFT JOIN existing_table e ON s.id = e.id
WHERE e.id IS NULL;

-- Result: ID 4 (Diana) is a new insert


-- Step 3: Identify UPDATES (records that exist in both but have different values)
-- ============================================================================

SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.name,
    s.address,
    s.salary,
    'UPDATE' AS change_type,
    -- Show what changed
    CASE WHEN s.name != e.name THEN 'name' ELSE '' END AS name_changed,
    CASE WHEN s.address != e.address THEN 'address' ELSE '' END AS address_changed,
    CASE WHEN s.salary != e.salary THEN 'salary' ELSE '' END AS salary_changed
FROM staging_table s
INNER JOIN existing_table e ON s.id = e.id
WHERE 
    s.name != e.name OR
    s.address != e.address OR
    s.salary != e.salary;

-- Result: ID 1 (address changed), ID 3 (salary changed)


-- Step 4: APPLY CHANGES - Method 1 (Using MERGE - SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL 15+)
-- ============================================================================

MERGE INTO existing_table AS target
USING staging_table AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED AND (
    target.name != source.name OR
    target.address != source.address OR
    target.salary != source.salary
) THEN
    UPDATE SET
        target.name = source.name,
        target.address = source.address,
        target.salary = source.salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (id, name, address, salary)
    VALUES (source.id, source.name, source.address, source.salary);


-- Step 5: APPLY CHANGES - Method 2 (Using separate INSERT and UPDATE)
-- ============================================================================

-- Insert new records
INSERT INTO existing_table (id, name, address, salary)
SELECT s.id, s.name, s.address, s.salary
FROM staging_table s
LEFT JOIN existing_table e ON s.id = e.id
WHERE e.id IS NULL;

-- Update existing records
UPDATE existing_table e
SET 
    e.name = s.name,
    e.address = s.address,
    e.salary = s.salary
FROM staging_table s
WHERE e.id = s.id
AND (
    e.name != s.name OR
    e.address != s.address OR
    e.salary != s.salary
);


-- Step 6: COMPLETE CDC PROCESS with audit columns

unity catalog

**On Governance and Unity Catalog**
*   "when we talk about governance it means we need to make our data secure available and accurate".
*   "Unity catalog is first of all an open source unified governance".
*   "this unified means you have to Define it once and you can secure it everywhere".
*   "it provides security it provides auditing it provides lineage capability it provides data Discovery".
*   "without Unity catalog you have to manage each databas workspace individually".
*   "with unity catalog you can maintain everything from a single place".

**On the Object Model**
*   **Metastore:** "in the object model topmost is the metastore and it is used to maintain your metadata". "metadata is your data about data it means it captures your schema it captures your Access Control List It captures your permissions and all sort of things". "one region should have one meta store".
*   **Catalog:** "catalog is the data securable object". "catalogs are basically used to maintain our data assets".
*   **Schemas:** "you can Define schemas in order to maintain those into different schemas".
*   **Tables and Views:** "in order to maintain structured data you can use tables and Views".
*   **Volumes:** "volumes are basically some file systems that can be used to maintain either structured data or unstructured data or semi-structured data".
*   **Non-data securable objects:** "storage credentials external location share recipient provider connection and clean rooms... are used to maintain nonata securable objects".

**On Three Name Space and the Example**
*   **The explanation:** "three name space means you have to Define catalog schema and the table name in order to access it".
*   **The specific example:** "so if you have a catalog called Dev and if you have a schema 
called Bron and if you have a table called sales then your table name would be something like dev. br. sales".

Spark SQL Engine (Catalyst Optimizer)**


**Potential Interview Questions Discussed:**
Video ke start mein bataya gaya hai ki interview mein kya puchha ja sakta hai:
*   Catalyst Optimizer ya Spark SQL Engine kya hai aur kaise kaam karta hai?
*   **Analysis Exception** error kyu aata hai aur isko kaise resolve kiya jata hai?
*   **Catalog** kya hota hai?
*   **Physical Planning** ya **Spark Plan** kya hai? (Dono term same hain).
*   Kya Spark SQL Engine ek **Compiler** hai? (Answer: Yes, kyunki ye code ko Java Byte Code mein convert karta hai).
*   Spark SQL Engine mein kitne **Phases** involve hote hain? (Answer: 4 phases).

**The 4 Phases of Spark SQL Engine**
Youtuber ne explain kiya ki ye engine **4 phases** mein kaam karta hai:
1.  **Analysis**
2.  **Logical Planning**
3.  **Physical Planning**
4.  **Whole Stage Code Generation**

In phases ko detail mein aur examples ke saath is tarah samjhaya gaya hai:

**1. Analysis Phase aur Catalog (Example ke saath)**
*   **Concept:** Jab hum code likhte hain to wo "Unresolved Logical Plan" hota hai. Yahan **Catalog** ka use hota hai.
*   **Catalog kya hai:** Catalog ke paas **Metadata** hota hai, matlab "Data ka data." Jaise file ka naam kya hai, kab load kiya gaya, size kya hai, aur table/files exist karte hain ya nahi.
*   **Example (Analysis Exception):**
    Youtuber ne ek example dikhaya jahan unhone ek JSON file ko read kiya.
    Unhone code likha: `df.select("name1")`.
    Lekin actual data mein column ka naam tha **"name"** ("name1" wahan tha hi nahi).
    Is wajah se code "fat gaya" aur **Analysis Exception** error aaya. Catalog ne check kiya aur bataya ki ye column exist nahi karta.
    Jab sab sahi hota hai tab ye **"Resolved Logical Plan"** banta hai.

**2. Logical Planning / Optimization (Example ke saath)**
*   **Concept:** Yahan **Logical Optimization** chalta hai. Spark lazy evaluation ka use karke code ko optimize karta hai.
*   **Example:**
    Agar aapne query likhi `Select * from table` (saare columns lao), lekin baad mein uske upar aap sirf **2 columns** use kar rahe ho.
    To Optimizer samajh jata hai ki user ne pehle pure columns select kiye hain jiski requirement nahi hai. Wo code ko change kar dega taaki shuru se hi sirf wo 2 columns aayein. Isse network se pura data uthane ka bada task bach jata hai.
    Isi tarah agar multiple filters (transformations) hain, to unhe combine kar diya jata hai.
    Isse **"Optimized Logical Plan"** banta hai.

**3. Physical Planning (Example ke saath)**
*   **Concept:** Logical plan se multiple physical plans banaye jate hain. Yahan **Cost Based Model** apply hota hai (kisme memory aur CPU kam lagega). Jo sabse best hota hai use **"Best Physical Plan"** kehte hain.
*   **Example (Broadcast Join):**
    Agar aapne **Join** lagaya hai aur ek table bada hai aur ek table chhota hai.
    Physical planning mein decide hota hai ki kya karein. Example diya ki chhote wale table ko saare executors ke paas bhej dete hain (Broadcast kar dete hain).
    Executors ko bola jata hai "tumhare paas chhota table hai, ise join kar lo."
    Isse data ko **Shuffle** (idhar-udhar move) nahi karna padta, jo ki ek expensive operation hai. Ye cost bacha leta hai.

**4. Whole Stage Code Generation**
*   End mein, jo Best Physical Plan hota hai wo **RDDs** (Resilient Distributed Datasets) mein convert hota hai.
*   Ye code alag-alag **Executors** ke paas bheja jata hai run karne ke liye.
*   Youtuber ne confirm kiya ki Spark SQL Engine ek compiler hai kyunki ye finally code ko **Java Byte Code** mein convert kar raha hai.

How to read json file in pyspark

1. JSON Kya Hota Hai (What is JSON) JSON ka full form hota hai JavaScript Object Notation. Ye ek key-value pair ka data hai.
• Example: Agar hum tabular format ki baat karein jahan ID aur Name hai, toh JSON mein hum curly bracket { se start karte hain. Pehle key likhte hain (column name) double quote mein, phir colon :, aur phir value.
    ◦ Jaise: {"id": 1, "name": "manish"}.
• Semi-structured Data: Iska advantage ye hai ki ye semi-structured hai. Maan lo ki ek ka salary hai aur ek ka nahi hai, ya kisi ka ek extra column "Nominee" add karna hai. Tabular format mein humein pura column add karna padta aur baaki jagah null value hoti, jisse space zyada lagta. Lekin JSON mein hum sirf specific record mein wo key-value add kar sakte hain.
2. Line-Delimited vs. Multi-Line JSON Spark mein JSON do type ke aate hain:
• Line-Delimited: Har ek line mein ek record hota hai. Spark by default line-delimited JSON hi accept karta hai. Isme performance fast hoti hai kyunki wo line-by-line read karta hai.
• Multi-Line: Agar teen-chaar line mila ke ek JSON record banta hai, toh use multi-line JSON kehte hain. Iske liye humein option("multiline", "true") set karna padta hai.
    ◦ Performance: Multi-line mein performance thodi degrade milegi kyunki usko pure object ko ek baar mein read aur write karna padta hai.
3. Interview Questions aur Examples
• Question: Agar 3 keys hain aur ek record mein 4 keys aa gaye toh kya hoga?
    ◦ Example: Humare paas Name, Age, Salary teen keys hain, lekin ek record mein humne ek extra key Gender de diya.
    ◦ Explanation: Jab hum isko read karenge, toh Spark ek Gender column generate karega. Jahan-jahan usko value nahi mila wahan null set kar dega, aur jahan value mila (jaise "Male"), wahan value set kar dega.
• Question: Corrupted JSON (Invalid File) ke case mein kya hoga?
    ◦ Example: Ek record mein open bracket { hai lekin closing bracket } humne jaanbujh ke hata diya.
    ◦ Explanation: Spark error throw nahi karega balki uss specific row ko corrupted record batayega. Wo ek column bana dega jahan aapko wo data show karega ki ye data corrupt hai.

data lake vs delta lake vs data warehouse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6i6fQilAm8&t=81s
**What is Delta Lake?**
The speaker defines Delta Lake as an "open format storage layer that delivers reliability, security and performance on your data lake". It acts as a "single home for structured semi-structured and unstructured data".

To explain this, the video compares three components:

*   **Data Warehouse:** This is a traditional concept for storing huge amounts of data. However, it has limitations. It accepts "only structured data". Also, the computing resources (RAM, processor, storage) are "tightly coupled," meaning you cannot increase one component without exponentially increasing the others.
*   **Data Lake:** This solution "came to picture" to solve data warehouse problems. You can dump "huge amount of data" and it accepts any format (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured). It is "limitlessly scalable" with minimal effort. However, it has "poor support to asset [ACID] transactions" and is not suitable for DML operations.
*   **Delta Lake:** This is the "combination of best features" from the data warehouse and data lake. It is a storage layer "sitting on top of the data lake". It supports ACID transactions, scales easily, and ensures that if a process fails, it "will not leave the system corrupted".

**The Example Explained in the Video**
The speaker uses an example regarding **Schema on Write** to show how a Data Warehouse handles data validation compared to Data/Delta Lake.

*   **The Scenario:** "Let's say we are having one table it's containing employee id employee name and salary but the incoming record is having one extra field maybe date of joining".
*   **Data Warehouse Result:** Because the record is not compatible with the schema, "on right it would be discarded it would be removed".
*   **Delta Lake Result:** There is a concept of "schema evaluation," which means "even though there is a mismatch with the schema still it would be accepted".

**Key Features Highlighted**
*   **ACID Transactions:** The video explains that Data Warehouse supports these (Atomic, Consistency, Isolated, Durable), Data Lake has poor support, but Delta Lake "supports acid transactions very easily".
*   **Handling Corruption:** In a Data Lake, if a process fails while doing transformations, it leaves the system in a "corrupted state". Delta Lake, similar to a Data Warehouse, "would not leave the system in corrupt status".
*   **Metadata:** Delta Lake manages metadata. While the Data Lake contains raw data (like CSV or Parquet files), Delta Lake captures metadata "like what is the name of the column what is the data type" and statistics (min/max values) to perform better.

database vs data lake vs data warehouse
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn7CFCQLKOs&t=938s
### **Database**
*   **Explanation:** A database is "a system which holds data". It deals with "majorly transactional data," which is data "used on day-to-day basis". It is "best meant for oltp purpose" (Online Transactional Processing). It deals with "structured data" that "has certain format it's in the form of rows and columns". It deals with "recent data," perhaps "last five months data six months data," but "cannot hold years of data" because the "cost to store the data in database is high". It follows "schema on write," meaning "while writing itself it will give you an error if there is any mismatch".
*   **Examples:**
    *   "If you go to a bank and swipe your card and you withdraw some 5000 rupees then it's a transaction which is happening".
    *   "You go to a grocery store you purchase something that's a transaction".
    *   "You are purchasing something from amazon that's a transaction".
    *   "One good database" examples are "oracle" and "mysql".

### **Data Warehouse**
*   **Explanation:** A data warehouse "holds more data than a database and is mainly used for analytical purpose". It is for "olap online analytical processing". It is a place which will "keep lot of your historical data" to "find the insights". We migrate data here because if we run "complex queries" for analysis on a database, "day-to-day transactions will become slow". It deals with "structured data" and follows "schema on right" (similar to a database). It follows an "ETL process" (extract, transform, load), which "restricts our flexibility" because "before loading it to our data warehouse itself we need to get the data to a form which is desired". The storage cost is "high but lesser than your database".
*   **Examples:**
    *   "Amazon people want to find some insights around your purchase trends and they want to analyze your last 10 years data".
    *   "One good example of a data warehouse" is "teradata".

### **Data Lake**
*   **Explanation:** A data lake is meant to "get insights from huge amounts of data," but the "data is present in raw format". It can be "structured or... unstructured". It follows a "elt process" (extract, load, and then transform). We can "keep the data in its raw form" and "think of transformation only when required later". It is "cost effective" because it uses "cheap hardware or cheap storage," so you can keep "tens of years of data here freely". It follows "schema on read," meaning "first you put a file... next what i do is i create a structure on top of it". It gives "enough flexibility... to keep all your raw data" and "later whenever you want to use it... feel free to use".
*   **Examples:**
    *   "Hdfs" and "amazon s3" are "good examples of data lakes".
    *   "If i have a log file doc file... we can directly have this file in raw form".
    *   Putting a file like "employee.csv" and creating a "hive table on top of it".

Dag and lazy evaluaton

**1. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Kya Hai**
*   DAG ka full form hota hai **Directed Acyclic Graph**. Iska matlab hai ki ye **cycle mein nahi jayega, ye loop mein kabhi nahi jayega**, ye directed hoga aur graph hoga.
*   Jitne bhi humne transformations likhe hain, ye usi ka ek graph banata hai ki pehle ye kaam karenge uske baad ye kaam karenge.
*   **Har ek action pe ek job banega aur har ek job ka apna DAG hoga**,.
*   Visualisation mein jo boxes hote hain wo vertices hote hain aur jo arrow hote hain wo edges hote hain.

**2. Lazy Evaluation**
*   Lazy Evaluation ka matlab hai ki **jab tak hum action ko hit nahi karenge tab tak ye jitni bhi transformations hain wo nahi hogi**.
*   Code line by line run karne ki koshish nahi karta. Ye shanti se baitha hua hai aur wait kar raha hai ki jab tum action hit karoge tabhi hum kaam karna shuru karenge.
*   Ye aisa isliye karta hai taaki ye code ko **optimize** karega.

**3. Example: Flight Data Analysis**
Video mein **Flight CSV data** ka example use kiya gaya hai. Isme teen main columns dikhaye gaye: Destination Country Name, Origin Country Name, aur Count.

Youtuber ne is example ke through Lazy Evaluation aur Optimization explain kiya:

*   **Step 1 (Transformations):** Unhone code ko chote-chote chunk mein chalaya. Pehle `repartition` kiya, fir `filter` lagaya (Narrow dependency), fir `groupBy` lagaya (Wide dependency),.
*   **Observation:** Jab tak sirf transformations run kiye (jaise filter lagana), tab tak **Spark job ka count nahi badha** (wo 2 ka 2 hi raha). Isse pata chala ki ye Lazy Evaluation kar raha hai,.
*   **Step 2 (Action):** Jaise hi last line (Action) ko hit kiya, job create hua aur count 2 se 4 ho gaya.
*   **Internal Optimization:** Example mein do filters lagaye gaye the:
    1.  Destination Country Name = **United States**.
    2.  Origin Country Name = **India** ya **Singapore**.
*   Ideally, pehle United States wala filter hona chahiye tha fir dusra code run hona chahiye tha. Lekin Spark ne **in dono step ko combine kar diya** aur ek baar mein hi calculate kar liya.
*   Isse ye fayda hua ki usko do baar processing karne ki zarurat nahi padi.

**4. Spark UI**
*   Jo hum application ke status ko dekhte hain (Jobs, Stages, DAG), usi ko bolte hain **Spark UI**,.
*   Yahan par hum dekh sakte hain ki kaise code optimize hua hai aur SQL query kaise bani hai,.

(
Lazy evaluation facilitates internal code optimisation in Spark by allowing the system to wait until
an 'action' is triggered before executing any transformations, rather than processing code line-by-line immediately.
Instead of running each step as it encounters it, Spark sits quietly 
and builds a plan—specifically a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)—which represents the sequence of jobs required.
This delay allows Spark to view the entire chain of transformations holistically, 
enabling it to combine steps and remove redundancies before touching the data.

transformation and action

**1. Transformation aur Action kya hote hain**
*   **Transformation:** Iska matlab hum koi bhi data pe kuch bhi **processing** karenge. Jaise agar hum filter kar rahe hain ya select kar rahe hain columns ko, toh usko transformation bolte hain,.
*   **Action:** Action matlab jab hum bolte hain ki kuch kaam humko chahiye, jaise ki `.show` ya `.count`. Jab tak action hit nahi karoge, Spark data ko scan nahi karega kyunki **Spark lazy evaluation** hai. Woh wait karega aur dekhega ki action hit hua toh hi woh kaam karega,.

**2. Types of Transformations**
Transformations do type ke hote hain:

*   **Narrow Dependency Transformation:** Aise transformations jisme data movement ki requirement nahi hoti between partitions. Isme ek executor akele apna kaam kar lega, usko dusre executor ya partition pe depend nahi rehna padta,,.
*   **Wide Dependency Transformation:** Jahan pe ek executor ko dusre executor se baat karke cheezein sort out karni padegi. Isme data ki movement hoti hai ek jagah se dusri jagah, aur jab ye movement hoti hai toh ye **expensive operation** ho jata hai. Hamesha Wide Dependency se bachna chahiye. Examples hain: `Group By`, `Join`, `Distinct`.

**3. Examples jo Video mein explain kiye gaye (Employee Data)**
YouTuber ne ek CSV file ka example liya jisme Employee ka data hai (ID, Name, Income, Age) aur do questions solve kiye concept samjhane ke liye,.

*   **Example 1: Narrow Dependency (Filter)**
    *   **Question:** "Show me the employee who is less than 18." (Aise employee dikhao jinki age 18 se kam hai).
    *   **Explanation:** Maan lo data ke do partition hain aur do executor hain. Executor 1 apne data mein check karega aur Executor 2 apne data mein. Dono apna-apna result return kar denge. Kahin pe bhi **data ko move karne ki zarurat nahi padi**. Isliye ye **Narrow Dependency** hai,.

*   **Example 2: Wide Dependency (Group By)**
    *   **Question:** "Find out the total income of each employee." (Kyunki ek employee ke multiple source of income ho sakte hain),.
    *   **Explanation:** Agar hum `Group By ID` karte hain, aur maan lo ID '2' Executor 1 ke partition mein bhi hai aur Executor 2 ke partition mein bhi hai. Agar data shift nahi karenge toh answer galat aayega.
    *   Sahi answer ke liye **Data ki Shuffling** hogi. Matlab same ID wale data ko same partition mein move karna padega taaki total sum calculate ho sake. Jab data idhar se udhar network mein move hoga, toh ye **expensive transformation** (Wide Dependency) kehlayega,.

**4. Driver Out of Memory aur Jobs**
*   Jab bhi action hit hota hai (jaise `.collect`), toh executor sara data process karke **Driver** ko bhejta hai.
*   Agar tumne zyada data maang liya (maan lo Driver 10GB ka hai aur 15GB data maang liya), toh **Driver Out of Memory Exception** aayega aur job fail ho jayega.
*   Jab bhi action hit hoga, tab tab naya **Job** create hoga.

Handling courupted record

**1. Potential Interview Questions**
Video ki shuruat mein bataya gaya hai ki is topic se related ye questions pooche ja sakte hain:
*   Kya aapne kabhi corrupted record ko handle kiya hai?
*   Humein kaise pata chalega ki record corrupted hai?
*   Agar hum alag-alag "Read Mode" mein read kar rahe hain to corrupted record ke saath kya hoga?
*   Bad records ko hum kaise print karwa sakte hain?
*   Corrupted records ko kahan store karte hain? (Kyunki agar hazaar records corrupt hain to hum print nahi karwaenge, store karenge).

**2. Corrupted Record ka Example**
Unhone CSV aur JSON ke examples diye hain:
*   **JSON:** Agar koi record hai aur uska last mein closing (bracket) nahi hai, to wo 'bad record' ho jayega kyunki wo properly close nahi hua.
*   **CSV (Main Example):** Ek table dikhaya gaya hai jisme 6 columns hain. Isme third record ke "Address" column mein "Bangalore, India" likha hai. Kyunki CSV ka matlab "Comma Separated Value" hota hai, to ye Bangalore aur India ko alag-alag consider kar lega. Is wajah se 'India' agle column 'Nominee' mein chala jayega aur data shift ho jayega. To ye ek bad record ban jayega.

**3. Different Read Modes ke Results**
Video mein practical karke dikhaya gaya ki same CSV file ko alag-alag mode mein read karne par kya aata hai:
*   **Permissive Mode:** Isme paanchon ke paanchon records aa jayenge. Jo record galat hoga, Spark usko "Null" set kar dega lekin error throw nahi karega.
*   **Drop Malformed:** Ye corrupted record ko drop kar dega. Example mein 2 record galat the (ek Bangalore wala aur ek Kolkata wala), to total 3 records hi aayenge.
*   **Fail Fast:** Isme 0 record aayega kyunki jaise hi bad record milega, wo process ko fail kar dega.

**4. Bad Records ko Print karna**
Bad records ko print karne ke liye "Manual Schema" define karna padta hai:
*   Schema mein ek extra column `_corrupt_record` (underscore corrupt underscore record) banana padta hai jiska type String hota hai.
*   Jab isko run karte hain, to corrupted data us column mein aa jata hai. Pura data dekhne ke liye `truncate=False` ka use karte hain.

**5. Corrupted Records ko Store karna**
Agar bahut saare records corrupted hain, to unhe store karne ke liye `badRecordsPath` option ka use karte hain:
*   Value mein wo path dete hain jahan aap store karna chahte hain. Ye ek directory bana deta hai aur wahan JSON format mein file store hoti hai.
*   Is command ko chalate waqt 'mode' specify karna allowed nahi hota.
*   Baad mein us JSON file ko read karke dekh sakte hain ki kis file aur kis reason ki wajah se record corrupt hua.

df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .schema(employee_schema) \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .option("badRecordsPath", bad_records_path) \
    .load("dbfs:/FileStore/tables/employees.csv")
employee_schema = StructType([
    StructField("id", IntegerType(), True),
    StructField("name", StringType(), True),
    # ... (other columns like address, nominee etc.)
    StructField("_corrupt_record", StringType(), True) # This column captures the bad data
])

# Read using the schema
df = spark.read.format("csv") \
    .schema(employee_schema) \
    .option("header", "true") \
    .load("dbfs:/FileStore/tables/employees.csv")

Schema in Spark

**Introduction & Interview Questions**
Starting mein hi humne interview questions discuss kar liye taaki humein idea lag jaye ki agar hum ye padhte hain toh interview mein kis tarah ke questions aa sakte hain. Possible questions ye hain:
1.  **How to create schema in PySpark?** (Manual schema kaise create karte hain).
2.  **What are other ways?** (Kya iske alawa koi aur tarika hai schema create karne ka?).
3.  **StructType aur StructField** ka concept kya hota hai?.
4.  Agar header pehle se pada hua hai aur hum header ko false kar dein, yaani **rows skip karna hai**, toh wo kaise karenge?.

**Key Concepts Explained**

*   **Schema create karne ke do tarike hain:**
    1.  **StructType aur StructField** ke through.
    2.  **DDL String** ke through.

*   **StructType & StructField:**
    *   **StructType:** Ye Dataframe ke structure ko define karta hai. Ye basically collection of StructFields hai.
    *   **StructField:** Ye column ki information rakhta hai. Jaise ki column ka naam, uska datatype (kya wo integer hai ya string hai), aur kya wo value null ho sakti hai (nullable true/false).

**Example 1: Basic Data Frame (Laptop Screen Explanation)**
Youtuber ne concept samjhane ke liye ek chhota sa Data Frame banaya jisme teen columns the: **ID, Name, aur Age**.

1.  **Method 1 (StructType & StructField):**
    Unhone `pyspark.sql.types` se `StructType` aur `StructField` import kiya.
    Code kuch aisa likha:
    ```python
    schema = StructType([
        StructField("id", IntegerType(), True),
        StructField("name", StringType(), True),
        StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
    ])
    ```
    Isme list pass kiya kyunki multiple columns the.

2.  **Method 2 (DDL String):**
    Ye method bahut aasan hai. Isme bas string pass karna hai column name aur type ke saath.
    Example:
    ```python
    ddl_schema = "id integer, name string, age integer"
    ```
    Youtuber ne kaha ki ye "bacchon wala kaam" hai agar pehla method samajh aa gaya toh.

**Example 2: Flight Data (Databricks Notebook Implementation)**
Phir unhone same cheez ko Databricks notebook par replicate kiya using **Flight Data CSV**.

*   **Scenario:** Unhone `header` ko `false` kar diya kyunki unhe apna manual schema banana tha.
*   **Schema Definition:** Unhone `my_schema` define kiya jisme columns the:
    *   `DEST_COUNTRY_NAME` (StringType)
    *   `ORIGIN_COUNTRY_NAME` (StringType)
    *   `count` (IntegerType).

*   **Issue (Null Values):**
    Jab data read kiya, toh `count` column mein `null` aa raha tha. Kyunki data mein pehla row header tha ("count" likha hua), aur schema mein wo Integer tha. String "count" integer nahi ho sakta, isliye Spark ne usko null kar diya.

*   **Solution (Skip Rows):**
    Agar humein header khud se hatana hai (kyunki humne `header=false` kiya hai lekin file mein header hai), toh hum `.option("skipRows", 1)` use kar sakte hain.
    Jaise hi `skipRows` 1 kiya, pehla row skip ho gaya aur sahi data (integers) aane laga.

Youtuber ne end mein ye bhi bataya ki ye sab options (jaise `skipRows`, `mode`) samajhne ke liye Spark documentation padhna chahiye.

spark architecture
**1. Cluster Setup (Example Scenario)**
Sabse pehle unhone Cluster ka example diya hai. 
*   "Cluster matlab kya? Bahut sare computers ko ek saath connect kar do network ke through."
*   **Example Setup:** Unhone 10 machines ka example liya hai.
    *   "20 core per machine."
    *   "Har ek machine me 100 GB RAM laga hua hai."
    *   Total calculate karein toh: "200 core" aur "1000 GB (1 TB)" RAM ka cluster hai.

**2. Master-Slave Architecture**
Cluster kaise kaam karta hai, isko unhone "Malik aur Naukar" ke example se samjhaya hai:
*   Cluster mein ek "Master" hota hai (Malik) aur baaki "Slaves" hote hain (Naukar).
*   Master node par "Resource Manager" install hota hai.
*   Slave nodes ko "Worker Node" ya "Node Manager" bolte hain.

**3. Application Submission Flow (Step-by-Step)**
Developer jab code submit karta hai, toh process kaise chalta hai:
*   **Request:** Developer ek application run karne ko bolta hai aur demand karta hai: "Hamein Driver de do 20 GB ka, aur Executors 25 GB ka aur number of Executors 5 aur CPU core de do 5".
*   **Driver Allocation:** Ye request "Resource Manager" ke paas jati hai. Wo dekhta hai ki Driver chahiye, toh wo kisi ek Worker Node (jaise example mein `w5` liya) ko bolta hai: "Please create container with 20 GB of RAM".
*   **Application Master:** Worker node (`w5`) apne 100GB mein se 20GB ka ek Container banata hai. Is container ke andar "Spark Application" run hota hai. Spark mein is container ko "Application Master" bolte hain.

**4. PySpark Internal Working**
Container ke andar kya hota hai, ye bahut important part hai:
*   Agar hum Python (PySpark) use kar rahe hain, toh bhi internally ek "JVM ka main method" create hota hai kyunki Spark core Scala (Java based) mein likha hai.
*   Python code pehle convert hota hai aur Java wrapper ke through chalta hai. Is JVM main method ko "Application Driver" bolte hain.
*   Agar humne Java/Scala mein code likha hai toh seedha Application Driver banta hai, lekin Python mein "PySpark Driver" aur "Application Driver" dono hote hain.

**5. Executor Allocation**
Jab Driver set ho jata hai, tab wo baaki resources mangta hai:
*   Application Driver wapas "Resource Manager" ke paas jata hai aur bolta hai ki "5 Executors, 25-25 GB ke aur 5 Core ke saath" chahiye.
*   Resource Manager dekhta hai kaunse Workers free hain. Example mein usne `w2, w3, w4, w7, w8` ko choose kiya aur wahan 5 containers create kar diye.
*   Ab Driver in containers (Executors) ko data aur tasks bhejta hai.

**6. Python UDF (User Defined Function) ka Masla**
YouTuber ne Python UDF use karne se mana kiya hai aur uska reason bataya hai:
*   Agar humne application mein "User Defined Function (UDF)" likha hai, toh Executer ke andar sirf JVM se kaam nahi chalega.
*   Wahan "Python Worker" ki zarurat padegi runtime environment mein.
*   Isliye bola jata hai ki UDF mat use karo, kyunki "Python Worker" aane se performance slow ho jati hai. In-built functions use karoge toh performance zyada milega.

**Summary:**
Process simple hai: Developer Resource Manager se Driver mangta hai -> Driver create hota hai -> Driver Resource Manager se Executors mangta hai -> Executors milte hain -> Kaam shuru hota hai. Jab kaam complete ho jata hai, Driver aur Executors band ho jate hain.

Read Data in Spark
Video mein bataya gaya hai ki data ko Spark mein kaise read karte hain. Iska ek core structure hota hai DataFrameReader API ke through.
1. General Format: Data read karne ke liye hum spark.read use karte hain, aur uske baad alag-alag options aate hain:
    ◦ .format(): Yahan hum file format batate hain, jaise CSV, JSON, ya Parquet. Agar hum .format() nahi dete hain, toh by default Spark parquet format samajhta hai.
    ◦ .option(): Isme hum key aur value pass karte hain (jaise header, mode). Ye optional field hai, hum de bhi sakte hain aur nahi bhi.
    ◦ .schema(): Agar humein manually batana hai ki column integer hoga ya string, toh hum schema define kar sakte hain.
    ◦ .load(): Yahan humein batana hota hai ki data kahan reside kar raha hai (data ka path/location).
2. Read Modes in Spark: Video mein explain kiya gaya hai ki data read karte waqt 3 tarike ke modes hote hain, aur interview mein isse question aate hi aate hain:
    ◦ Fail Fast: Jaise hi koi corrupted record (malformed record) mile, execution ko fail kar do.
    ◦ Drop Malformed: Ye corrupted record ko seedha drop kar dega.
    ◦ Permissive: Ye default mode hota hai. Agar koi corrupt record milega, toh ye us value ko null set kar dega.

**Spark Ecosystem ka Structure**
Video mein Spark ke structure ko do hisson mein baant kar samjhaya gaya hai:

*   **Low Level API (Spark Core):** Spark ka jo niche wala section hai, use "Spark Core" bolte hain. Isme RDD (Resilient Distributed Datasets) aata hai. Agar humein bilkul hi low level par jaakar kuch likhna hai, ya koi aisi cheez achieve karni hai jo High Level API se nahi ho pa rahi, toh wahan par hum RDD ka use karte hain.
*   **High Level API (Libraries):** Jo top mein hai, wo "Set of Libraries" hai jise "High Level API" bhi bolte hain. Isme Data Frame aur Spark SQL aata hai jo Spark Core ke upar run karta hai. Iske alava agar streaming karni hai, machine learning karni hai, ya graph wali cheezein karni hain (GraphX), toh uski libraries bhi available hain.
*   **Kaise Run hota hai:** Hum jo bhi kuch karne wale hain (High Level API mein), wo internally transform hoga Spark ke Core mein (RDD mein) aur phir Spark ke Computer Engine mein jayega.
*   **Languages:** Spark ne flexibility di hai ki aap apne code ko multiple languages mein likh sakte ho jaise Python, Java, R, aur Scala.

**Hardware aur Cluster Manager**
YouTuber ne samjhaya hai ki Spark na hi storage karta hai aur na hi Spark ka khud ka kuch cluster manager hota hai.
*   Sabse base par "Hardware" ya "Computer Machines" baithe hote hain.
*   In machines ko manage karne ke liye inke upar "Cluster Manager" baitha hota hai jo hardware se baat karta hai.
*   Cluster Manager ke kuch popular naam hain: YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), Mesos, aur Standalone Cluster.

**Example (100 GB Calculation)**
Video mein process ko run karne ka example diya gaya hai ki kaise Spark Engine aur Cluster Manager interact karte hain:

1.  Spark Engine Cluster Manager ke paas jayega aur bolega ki humein "20 GB ki 4 Executor" chahiye aur "ek 20 GB ka Driver" chahiye.
2.  Total requirement calculation:
    *   Executors: $20 \times 4 = 80$ GB
    *   Driver: $20$ GB
    *   **Total = 100 GB**.
3.  Cluster Manager check karega ki uske paas 100 GB available hai ki nahi.
4.  Agar memory hai, toh wo process ko run karne ke liye bhejega. Agar nahi hai, toh wo bolega ki hum queue mein rakh dete hain jo "FIFO order" (First In First Out) mein chalta hai. Matlab jo pehla application run hoga, use memory pehle mil jayega.

Hadoop vs Spark

**1. Market mein Misconceptions (Galatfehmiyan)**
Video ke starting mein 3 main misconceptions batayi gayi hain:
*   **Hadoop Database nahi hai:** "Hadoop aisa koi database nahi hai yeh framework hai... Log Hive use karte hain to unhein lagta hai ki yeh relational database hai... lekin actual mein wo ek file system hota hai".
*   **Spark Speed:** "Spark jo hai wo 100 times faster hota hai lekin ye actual aisa nahi hota hai... yeh 100 times tak ja sakta hai, 'up to' hota hai".
*   **RAM Usage:** "Teesri misconception hai wo hai ki Spark jo hai wo RAM mein data ko process karta hai lekin Hadoop aisa nahi karta hai... Hadoop ko bhi RAM ki hi zarurat hoti hai".

**2. Performance Difference (Kaise kaam karte hain)**
*   **Hadoop Process:** "Hadoop is slower than Spark... Hadoop ko bhi RAM ki hi zarurat hoti hai... lekin usko baad mein usko write kar deta hai disk par... to jo RAM se disk write karne mein time jata hai wahan se slow ho jata hai". Example ke liye, Mapper load kiya, reduce kiya aur fir wapas disk pe write kiya. Fir agla process disk se read karega. Ye baar-baar Read/Write cycle chalta hai.
*   **Spark Process:** "Spark ke case mein kya ho raha hai ki... alag-alag executor isko read kar liya... write karega kisi apne executor ke... memory hoga jo ki basically RAM hai... to basically yeh kya kar raha hai ki yeh kabhi disk par gaya hi nahi... iski wajah se iska process fast ho gaya".
*   **Exception Case:** Agar data cluster mein wahin par fit ho ja raha hai (jaise 10GB ka data hai aur sirf count karna hai), toh "uss case mein... time ke case mein... 100 times faster ya 100 times slower hai aisa case to nahi aayega", hardley 1-2 times ka difference hoga,.

**3. Batch vs Streaming**
*   **Hadoop:** "Hadoop build kiya hai batch data processing ke liye... us samay... data bahut zyada volume mein generate hona shuru ho gaya hai... to wo batch mein process karne ke liye banaya gaya tha".
*   **Spark:** "Spark ke paas advantage hai... ye batch ko to handle kar hi sakta hai uske alawa ye streaming ko bhi handle kar sakta hai... kyunki humein jaldi-jaldi data ko process karna hai",.

**4. Ease of Use (Code likhna)**
*   **Hadoop:** "Hadoop mein kya hai ki code likhna bahut hi mushkil tha starting se hi... thoda tough hai likhna".
*   **Spark:** "Spark mein aur bhi easy bana diya gaya hai... Spark ne High Level API de rakha hai ki yahan se aap apne alag-alag language ke through likh sakte ho... Java, SQL, Python, R ye saare language ke through".

**5. Security**
*   **Hadoop:** "Security mein Hadoop ko zyada security hai". Ye "Kerberos authentication ka use karta hai" check karne ke liye ki user authorized hai ya nahi,. Folders access karne ke liye ye "ACLs (Access Control Lists)" use karta hai.
*   **Spark:** "Spark directly aisa koi humein security ke liye nahi deta hai... Spark jo hai hamara wo kya karta hai ki wo HDFS ka storage use kar leta hai... aur jaise hi YARN use karega apna resource negotiate karne ke liye to isko Kerberos mil jata hai".

**6. Fault Tolerance (Video wala Example)**
Manish ne Fault Tolerance samjhane ke liye ye example diya:

*   **Hadoop Example (Replication):**
    Man lo ek data hai "260 MB ka... 128 MB ka ek block size banta hai... to iske kitne banenge teen banenge... A, B aur C". Hadoop replication factor use karta hai (jaise ki 3). "A jo hai wo teen jagah pe store hoga alag-alag node pe... Machine 1, Machine 2 aur ye Machine 3".
    **Agar fail hua to:** "Maan lo ki hum data read kar rahe the Node 1 se... ab ye fail ho gaya... to A ko dekhega ki achha A ka data yahan pe bhi pada hua hai (dusre node par)... koi ek data ko read kar lega... iss tarah se hamara Hadoop fault tolerate hota hai",.

*   **Spark Example (DAG & Lineage):**
    "Spark kya karta hai ki Spark jo hai na wo DAG banata hai Directed Acyclic Graph". Iske paas RDD hota hai. "Isko pata hai ki process 1 ke baad fail hua hai... to process 1 ko banane ke liye kya laga tha kahan se data laga tha wo iske paas information hoti hai... wo us tarike se us data ka use karke wapas bana lega".

why apache spark

**1. Apache Spark ke aane se pehle kya tha? (Databases)**
Video mein bataya gaya hai ki Spark ke aane se pehle hamare paas **Databases** hote the (jaise Oracle, Teradata, MySQL). Ye systems sirf **Structured Format** wale data ko store karte the.
*   **Example:** Structured data ka matlab hai **Tabular format** mein data, jisme fixed rows aur columns hote hain. Isko aap apne **Excel sheet** jaisa samajh sakte ho.

**2. Problem kahan shuru hui? (Data Formats and Internet)**
Internet ke invention ke baad data alag-alag formats mein generate hone laga:
*   **Files:** Text files, CSV files.
*   **Multimedia:** Images, Videos.
*   **Semi-Structured Data:** JSON ya YAML format (jahan fixed structure nahi hota, key-value pairs hote hain),.
Purane databases sirf tabular data handle kar pa rahe the, baaki formats (Unstructured aur Semi-structured) ko handle karne ke liye koi system nahi tha.

**3. Big Data aur "Three Vs"**
Yahan "Big Data" ke concept ko samjhaya gaya hai **Three Vs** ke through:
*   **Volume:** Sirf size (jaise 100GB ya 1TB) hone se wo Big Data nahi ban jata.
*   **Velocity:** Data kis speed se aa raha hai.
    *   **Example:** Agar 10TB data **per second** ya **per hour** aa raha hai, tab hum bol sakte hain ki Big Data ki problem hai.
*   **Variety:** Data ke alag-alag forms (Structured, Semi-structured, Unstructured). Aaj kal market mein **Unstructured data** sabse zyada produce hota hai.

**4. ETL vs. ELT (Data Handling ka change)**
Pehle hum **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load) karte the (Data Warehouse concept). Lekin ab data ka volume aur velocity itna badh gaya hai ki hum **ELT** (Extract, Load, Transform) karte hain.
*   Iska matlab pehle hum source se data utha ke ek dump jagah (Data Lake) pe **Load** kar lete hain, aur baad mein jab time milta hai tab usko **Transform** karte hain,.

**5. Main Issues: Storage and Processing**
Itna zyada data aane se do badi problems aayi:
1.  **Storage:** Itna data store kahan karein?
2.  **Processing:** Data ko process karne ke liye RAM aur CPU chahiye,.

**6. Solution Approaches: Monolithic vs. Distributed**
In problems ko solve karne ke liye do options the:

*   **Monolithic Approach (Vertical Scaling):**
    *   Isme hum ek hi system ko bada banate hain (jaise hard disk ya CPU add karte jana).
    *   **Problem:** Iski ek limit hoti hai (Heat dissipation issue, performance drop). Ye **Expensive** hota hai aur isme **Single Point of Failure** hota hai (agar system fail hua to sab band),.

*   **Distributed Approach (Horizontal Scaling):**
    *   Isme hum multiple saste computers (commodity hardware) ko add karte hain.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   Ye **Economical** (sasta) padta hai.
        *   **Unlimited Scaling:** Hum jitne chahein computers add kar sakte hain.
        *   **High Availability:** Agar ek machine fail ho gayi, to doosri machine kaam sambhal leti hai,.

**Conclusion:**
Isi distributed approach ki wajah se pehle **Hadoop** aaya aur uske baad **Spark** aaya taaki hum Big Data ki storage aur processing problems (Velocity, Variety, Volume) ko solve kar sakein.

spark overview 

**What is Apache Spark?**
Video mein definition di gayi hai: "Apache Spark is a unified computing engine and set of libraries for parallel data processing on a computer cluster". Is definition ko samajhne ke liye YouTuber ne har term ko explain kiya hai:

**1. Unified**
*   **Explanation:** Unified ka matlab hota hai "sab cheez ko ek jagah la dena."
*   **Example:** Video mein example diya hai ki Data Engineer (pipeline banane wala), Data Analyst (sales analysis karne wala), aur Data Scientist (future predict karne wala)—agar ye teeno "ek hi software ya ek hi jagah pe kaam kar sakte hain, toh usi ko bolte hain Unified." Spark mein ye sab log ek hi computing engine par kaam kar sakte hain,.

**2. Computing Engine**
*   **Explanation:** Spark data ko store nahi karta hai. "Basically ye sara cheez RAM mein ho raha hota hai," jo ki permanent storage nahi hai.
*   **Example:** Jaise hamare laptop mein CPU task perform karta hai. Example diya ki "2+5 = 7... ye humein jo compute karne wali cheez hai wo kaun dega? Wo humein dega Spark." Agar 5 Terabyte ka data hai aur usme +1 karna hai, toh wo Spark compute karega. Storage ke liye S3, HDFS, ya RDBMS use hota hai kyunki Spark ke paas storage nahi hota,.

**3. Set of Libraries**
*   **Explanation:** Ye "set of code hota hai jo ki humein likh kar de diye jaate hain."
*   **Example:** Jaise aapne "Pandas" suna hoga, waise hi Spark mein libraries hoti hain jiska use karke hum aage ke kaam perform karte hain.

**4. Parallel Data Processing**
*   **Explanation:** Ek task ko multiple logon mein divide karke karwana.
*   **The Father-Son Example:** Yahan ek example explain kiya hai: "Maan lo ki ek baap hai, uske char bete hain. Ab baap ke paas total 10 task hain... toh wo kya karega do-do ya teen-teen task de dega do beton ko." Is tarah 10 task char beton mein divide ho gaye. "Charon bete apne apne independent task karenge aur shaam ko aakar result de denge." Agar baap akele karta toh time lagta, par beton ne mil kar jaldi kar diya. Same cheez Spark mein hoti hai jahan task alag-alag executors par bhej diya jata hai,.

**5. Computer Cluster**
*   **Explanation:** Spark "Master-Slave architecture" par kaam karta hai. "Ek machine jo ban gaya wo Master ban gaya aur baaki sare jo machines hain wo hamare ban gaye Slave (naukar)."
*   **Architecture Example:** Video mein assume kiya hai ki har computer (worker) ke paas "16GB ka RAM hai aur 1 Terabyte ka storage hai aur 4 core CPU hai."
*   **Process:** Agar Master ko 5 Terabyte data process karna hai, toh wo dekhega ki workers ke paas kitni capacity hai (jaise total 64GB ek baar mein). Master ka kaam hai data ko divide karna aur workers se kaam karwana,,.

Finally, video mein kaha gaya hai ki Spark ek "Unified Computing Engine hai... yaad rakhna storage nahi hota iske paas" aur ye parallel data processing karta hai computer clusters par.

Spark SQL Engine
In this lecture (Lec-8), Manish Kumar explains the Spark SQL Engine (also known as the Catalyst Optimizer) and the four phases it uses to convert high-level Spark code (SQL, DataFrames, or DataSets) into low-level Java bytecode for execution on a cluster.

1. The Spark SQL Engine Flow
The video breaks down the conversion of your code into the following four sequential phases:

Phase 1: Analysis & The Catalog [07:27]
When you write a query, Spark first creates an Unresolved Logical Plan.
It then uses the Catalog (a repository of metadata like table names, column types, and file locations) to verify if the tables or columns you referenced actually exist.
If a column or table is missing, Spark throws an Analysis Exception at this stage [09:13].

Phase 2: Logical Planning / Optimization [10:35]
Once the plan is resolved, Spark applies logical optimizations.
Example: If you write SELECT * but only use two columns later, Spark optimizes the plan to fetch only those two specific columns from the source to save network bandwidth. It also combines multiple filter transformations into one [11:42].

Phase 3: Physical Planning [12:37]
Spark takes the optimized logical plan and generates multiple Physical Plans.
It uses a Cost-Based Model to evaluate these plans. It calculates which plan will use the least amount of CPU and memory.
Example: It decides whether to perform a Broadcast Join (sending a small table to all executors) or a standard shuffle join based on table sizes to avoid expensive data shuffling [12:54].
The best performing plan is selected as the Selected Physical Plan.

Phase 4: Code Generation [06:17]
The final physical plan consists of RDD transformations. Spark uses Whole-Stage Code Generation to convert these into highly optimized Java bytecode that runs on the cluster's executors [14:50].

2. Key Interview Questions Answered [01:40]
What is the Catalyst Optimizer? It is the engine that converts your high-level code into an optimized physical execution plan.
Why do we get an Analysis Exception? This occurs during the first phase if the metadata (table/column names) doesn't match the Catalog [10:06].
What is the Catalog? It is a storage for metadata (data about data), such as file sizes and schema information [08:17].
Is Spark SQL Engine a compiler? Yes, because it ultimately translates high-level Spark code into Java bytecode for the machine to execute [16:39].

3. Example: Analysis Error [09:19]
Manish shows a code snippet where he tries to select a column named name1 from a JSON file, but the actual column name is name. Because the Catalyst Optimizer checks the Catalog during the Analysis phase and finds no match, it throws an error immediately before any data is even processed._______________________________________________________________________
Database vs datalake vs data warehouse
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
. Core Concepts Explained
Database (OLTP):

Purpose: Primarily used for day-to-day transactions (Online Transactional Processing). It focuses on high performance for immediate tasks [01:33].
Data Type: Deals only with structured data (rows and columns) [02:43].
Recent Data: It holds only recent data (e.g., last 5-6 months) to maintain speed; it cannot efficiently store years of historical data [03:12].
Schema: Uses Schema on Write, meaning the structure is validated before data is saved. Any mismatch results in an error during the writing process [04:18].

Cost: The storage cost is high [06:23].
Data Warehouse (OLAP):
Purpose: Used for analytical processing (Online Analytical Processing) and finding insights from large amounts of historical data [07:51].
Source: It aggregates data from multiple databases through an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process [14:52].
Schema: Like a database, it uses Schema on Write and deals with structured data [12:41].
Cost: Storage is expensive, though generally cheaper than a primary transactional database [13:16].

Data Lake:
Purpose: Meant to store huge amounts of raw data for later analysis. It offers maximum flexibility for various teams to use the data as they need [18:04].
Data Type: Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (like log files or docs) in its original form [17:56].
Process: Uses ELT (Extract, Load, Transform). Data is loaded first, and transformations happen only when the data is read [19:00].
Schema: Uses Schema on Read, allowing users to define the structure at the time of analysis [21:01].
Cost: Highly cost-effective as it uses cheap storage hardware [20:16].

2. Examples Provided
Database Example:
Scenario: Swiping your card at an ATM or purchasing an item on Amazon. These are instant transactions where your current balance must be updated immediately [01:16].
Systems: Oracle, MySQL [04:06].
Data Warehouse Example:
Scenario: Amazon analysts wanting to see your purchase trends over the last 10 years to find insights. They move data from the transactional database to a warehouse to run complex queries without slowing down the main site [08:15].
Systems: Teradata [13:16].
Data Lake Example:
Scenario: Storing a raw .csv or log file. You load the file into the system as-is and later create a structure (like a Hive table) on top of it to visualize the data [21:10].
Systems: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), Amazon S3 [19
__________________________________________________________
difference between Partitioning and Bucketing
Partitioning:
How it works: It divides data into multiple folders based on a specific column [03:02].
When to use: Use it when a column has low cardinality (limited distinct values), such as Country or Date [04:10].
Benefit: When you query for a specific value (e.g., Country = 'India'), the system only scans that specific folder instead of the entire dataset [03:21].

Bucketing:
How it works: It divides data into a fixed number of files using a hash function [06:21].
When to use: Use it when a column has high cardinality (many unique values), such as Customer ID or Zip Code [05:44].
Benefit: It distributes data evenly across a specified number of buckets (files) to manage large volumes of data that partitioning alone cannot handle efficiently [07:31].

2. Examples Provided
Partitioning Example [01:43]
Scenario: You have a table with billions of records including a Country column.
The Query: SELECT * FROM table WHERE Country = 'India'.
The Process: * Without partitioning, the system scans all 100 billion records.
With partitioning by Country, the system creates separate folders for India, USA, and UK.
The query goes directly to the India folder, drastically increasing speed [03:02].

Bucketing Example [06:41]
Scenario: You want to organize data by Customer ID (which has millions of unique values).
The Process:
You decide to create 4 buckets.
The system uses a hash function: Customer ID % 4.
If the result is 0, the data goes to Bucket 1; if it's 1, it goes to Bucket 2, and so on [07:07].
This results in exactly 4 files regardless of how many unique Customer IDs exist [07:17].


Partitioning:
SQL
CREATE TABLE zip_codes (...)
PARTITIONED BY (state STRING);
Bucketing:

SQL
CREATE TABLE zip_codes (...)
CLUSTERED BY (zip_code) INTO 10 BUCKETS;

What are the differences between Managed Identity and Service Principal, and when should each be used?

Answer: * Managed Identity: * What it is: An identity automatically created and managed by Azure for specific resources
(like Azure Data Factory). [03:15, 01:10:35] * When to use: Use it whenever possible (recommended by Microsoft) 
for authenticating between Azure resources that support it. [13:18] * Advantages: It is highly secure and easy to manage because Azure handles the credentials,
removing the need for manual key rotation. [11:09, 11:18] * Disadvantages: It is less flexible because users have little control over its configuration, 
and it is not supported by all services (e.g., Azure DevOps). [12:31, 07:54]

Service Principal:

What it is: A security identity used by applications, services, and automation tools (created via Azure Entra ID/Active Directory) to access specific Azure resources. [03:51, 10:45]
When to use: Use it when Managed Identity is not supported, or when an external service (like Azure DevOps) needs to access Azure resources. [13:43, 07:39]
Advantages: It is highly flexible; you can create as many as needed and use them across various internal and external services. [12:49, 12:56]
Disadvantages: It is less secure and harder to manage because you must manually handle credentials (secret keys) and rotate them before they expire. [11:35, 11:55]

(
Azure services:

Managed Identity Example (ADF to Databricks):

When you create Azure Data Factory (ADF), Azure automatically creates an identity for it.

To give ADF access to Azure Databricks, you simply go to the Databricks access control and select the "Managed Identity" of that specific Data Factory.

Service Principal Example (Azure DevOps to Databricks):

If you want to use Azure DevOps to run a CI/CD pipeline in Databricks, you cannot use a Managed Identity because Azure DevOps doesn't have one in the same way.

Instead, you must create a "third-party" ID called a Service Principal in Azure Entra ID (Active Directory).

You generate a Client ID and a Secret Key for this Service Principal and then provide those credentials to Azure DevOps so it can "log in" and perform tasks in Databricks

copying billion rows from a file to a database and identifies lines that are causing the problem. 
He suggests that the solution is to enable fault tolerance in the copy activity settings and check the "skip the incompatible rows" option. 
This will allow the compatible rows to be pushed into the database, while the incompatible rows can be found in the log

Edge Node (Gateway Node): 
An isolated machine outside the main cluster used for submitting Spark jobs. It serves security and organizational purposes:
Prevents direct user access to the cluster to avoid manual data corruption or security risks.
Handles authentication and authorization (e.g., via Kerberos) before jobs are submitted
Deployment Modes: The mode is determined by where the driver program runs.

Client Mode:
The driver runs on the edge node (client machine).
Logs are displayed directly on the user's screen, making it ideal for development and debugging.
Disadvantage: Higher network latency due to two-way communication between the edge node and the cluster.
Disadvantage: If the edge node is shut down or disconnected, the driver dies, and all executors are killed, stopping the process.

Cluster Mode:
The driver runs on one of the worker nodes inside the cluster.
Recommended for production workloads.
Advantage: Lower network latency since the driver and executors are within the same cluster.
Advantage: The edge node can be disconnected after submission without affecting the job, as the driver is already running in the cluster.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Question: How does Spark work? Can you quickly guide me through the Spark architecture? [00:01]

Answer: When you write a Spark application, the driver program gets executed. It follows several steps:
Schema Validation: It checks if the code is syntactically correct and matches the schema catalog. [00:15]
Unresolved Logical Plan: Once validated, it creates an unresolved logical plan. [00:26]
Logical Plan: A logical plan is created with the help of the Catalyst Optimizer, considering cost and roles. [00:39]
Physical Plan: Finally, a physical plan is created and then used for execution. [00:
______________________________________________________________
Question: What exactly is the difference between submitting a job in client mode or in cluster mode in Spark? [00:01]

Answer: - Client Mode: The driver program runs on the client machine [00:09]. This mode allows for interaction with the cluster results 
and is primarily used for development purposes, as it makes it easy to see the execution results from the cluster. [00:15]

Cluster Mode: The driver program runs on the cluster itself [00:25]. This mode is most commonly used for production environments. [00:31]
