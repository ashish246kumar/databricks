copying billion rows from a file to a database and identifies lines that are causing the problem. 
He suggests that the solution is to enable fault tolerance in the copy activity settings and check the "skip the incompatible rows" option. 
This will allow the compatible rows to be pushed into the database, while the incompatible rows can be found in the log

Edge Node (Gateway Node): 
An isolated machine outside the main cluster used for submitting Spark jobs. It serves security and organizational purposes:
Prevents direct user access to the cluster to avoid manual data corruption or security risks.
Handles authentication and authorization (e.g., via Kerberos) before jobs are submitted
Deployment Modes: The mode is determined by where the driver program runs.

Client Mode:
The driver runs on the edge node (client machine).
Logs are displayed directly on the user's screen, making it ideal for development and debugging.
Disadvantage: Higher network latency due to two-way communication between the edge node and the cluster.
Disadvantage: If the edge node is shut down or disconnected, the driver dies, and all executors are killed, stopping the process.

Cluster Mode:
The driver runs on one of the worker nodes inside the cluster.
Recommended for production workloads.
Advantage: Lower network latency since the driver and executors are within the same cluster.
Advantage: The edge node can be disconnected after submission without affecting the job, as the driver is already running in the cluster.

Question: How does Spark work? Can you quickly guide me through the Spark architecture? [00:01]

Answer: When you write a Spark application, the driver program gets executed. It follows several steps:
Schema Validation: It checks if the code is syntactically correct and matches the schema catalog. [00:15]
Unresolved Logical Plan: Once validated, it creates an unresolved logical plan. [00:26]
Logical Plan: A logical plan is created with the help of the Catalyst Optimizer, considering cost and roles. [00:39]
Physical Plan: Finally, a physical plan is created and then used for execution. [00:

Question: What exactly is the difference between submitting a job in client mode or in cluster mode in Spark? [00:01]

Answer: - Client Mode: The driver program runs on the client machine [00:09]. This mode allows for interaction with the cluster results 
and is primarily used for development purposes, as it makes it easy to see the execution results from the cluster. [00:15]

Cluster Mode: The driver program runs on the cluster itself [00:25]. This mode is most commonly used for production environments. [00:31]
